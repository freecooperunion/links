Its 18,000 art students each pay about $20,000 a year, collectively adding up to an estimated $360 million in tuition. About a third of its students live in Academy-owned housing, according to the school, which operates dormitories at locations throughout the city. If 5,000 students pay $1,000 a month for housing, that's another $60 million in potential revenue, for an estimated total exceeding $400 million. It is one of the largest art schools in the country.</p>\n<p>\"Bigger is better for us,\" said President <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/search/results?q=Elisa%20Stephens\">Elisa Stephens</a>, the third generation to run the for-profit school founded by her grandfather. \"It keeps tuition reasonably priced.\"</p>\n<p>When she took over from her father in 1992, there were 3,500 students, Stephens said. In 20 years she has more than quintupled the enrollment and revenue.</p>\n<p>\"There is a way to run a school for profit,\" she said. \"We just run it on tuition.\"</p>\n<p>That its growth spurt coincided with the younger Stephens' arrival is probably no accident. Stephens is trained as a lawyer, but her true calling is marketing the Academy of Art and its programs.</p>\n<p>She aims her pitch at high school students. \"If you want to be a pro artist, you should get goin' because you can be young,\" Stephens said. \"All the ideas are coming from 18- and 19-year-olds. When you are 30, you are old. When you are 40, you have to work at staying in the game. You can become old-fashioned.\"</p>\n<p>Her marketing message carries urgency. \"Clothes come out four times a year,\" Stephens said. \"Cars come out every year. Movies are coming out all the time. TV commercials are changing all the time. Art is moving very fast.\"</p>\n<blockquote>James Dunn is a senior editor at the San Francisco Business Times.
