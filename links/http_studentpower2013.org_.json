We spent three days learning about each other as organizers, as representatives of our geographic spaces and respective issues and as humans. We were inspired by the stories of international student movements. We trained together, we cooked together, we danced and cried together. We creative a beloved community on the foundational promise of moving forward in collective action towards collective wins.</p>\n<strong>We all left Columbus with a renewed sense of what a cohesive, intersectional movement should look and feel like.</strong> <p>Halting the Keystone XL Pipeline. Pushing marriage equality and broader LGBTQ/intersectional justice. Fighting for undocumented immigrants, DREAMERs, debt-strangled students, low-wage workers, and a generation at the margins of our inequitable economy. Fighting for our future, for fairness, justice, and love. Our movement is fighting harder than ever, but there's still so much that needs to be done. We can only do it together, as a bigger, more creative, nimble, united, diverse movement than we've seen yet.</p>\n<p>Let's move forward.</p>\n<strong>Here. Us.
