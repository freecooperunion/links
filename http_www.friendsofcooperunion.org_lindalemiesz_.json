Tough, fair, independent: as Dean of Student Services, these were the qualities that shaped her fierce advocacy of student issues.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lemiesz's extensive credentials as a Fulbright scholar, a lawyer, and an award-winning author give a glimpse into the wealth of experience she brought to Cooper Union. In her many responsibilities at Cooper- overseeing the Student Residence, Career Development, Financial Aid, and Athletics and Recreation- she touched the lives of generations of students. Thank you, Dr. Lemiesz, for your many years of service to Cooper Union. </p>\n<p>In President Bharucha's brief email to the community, he gave insultingly short shrift to Dr. Lemiesz. Bharucha's passive construction, \"[she] has left her position,\" gives the false impression that she abandoned her post. His decision to remove her just two weeks before parents and new students arrive for New Student Orientation is worrying. More disturbing is the pattern of his presidency to silence all individual voices critical of his decisions. This sad news would perhaps be less disconcerting if it did not come just days after TC Westcott's departure as VP of Finance and Administration. Now it appears Dr. Lemiesz is the latest victim of Cooper's \"reinvention.\"</p>\n<p>It will be difficult to fill Dr. Lemiesz's shoes, and impossible to do so with outside consultants. And yet, this too has become a hallmark of Bharucha's administration. For this reason, <a href=\"http://www.friendsofcooperunion.org/vote-no-confidence/\">we reiterate our \"no confidence\" in President Bharucha</a>. Over 2,350 members of the community have voted the same.</p>\n<p>It is clear that Cooper Union cannot thrive with President Bharucha as its president. Trustees: end this disastrous presidency before it ends Cooper Union. <br><br></p>\n<p><br><a href=\"http://www.friendsofcooperunion.org/lindalemiesz/\"><img src=\"http://cache-02.cleanprint.net/media/pfviewer/images/CleanPrintIcn_16x16.png\"></a><a href=\"http://www.friendsofcooperunion.org/lindalemiesz/\"><img src=\"http://cache-02.cleanprint.net/media/pfviewer/images/PdfIcn_16x16.png\"></a> </p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 5, "name": "Dr. Lemiesz"}, {"count": 5, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 5, "name": "Bharucha"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Linda Lemiesz"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Dean of Student Services"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Fulbright"}, {"count": 1, "name": "TC Westcott"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Athletics and Recreation"}, {"count": 1, "name": "VP of Finance and Administration"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Career Development"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [249, 248, 121], "weight": 0.837646484375}, {"color": [134, 136, 17], "weight": 0.162353515625}], "keywords": [{"score": 60, "name": "lemiesz"}, {"score": 50, "name": "bharucha"}, {"score": 31, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 25, "name": "student"}, {"score": 19, "name": "union"}, {"score": 13, "name": "presidency"}, {"score": 11, "name": "dean"}, {"score": 10, "name": "focu"}, {"score": 10, "name": "award-winning"}, {"score": 10, "name": "twenty-three"}], "published": 1376352000000, "provider_name": "Friendsofcooperunion", "type": "html"}
