The research concluded that within 10 years, students could face between $40,000 and $80,000 in tuition fees. Since we received and shared this document, other members of the community have stepped forward to clarify the nature of the report. It is our understanding now that this committee was one of many tasked to research revenue generation for the school. We struggle with the fact that all of this information has come to light solely from a leaked document, and not the from our expectations of transparency and candor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>( <em>Video: Aymann Ismail/ANIMALNewYork</em>)</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 1, "name": "Stefan Fink"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Free Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "School of Engineering"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [40, 41, 42], "weight": 0.050048828125}, {"color": [216, 216, 216], "weight": 0.012451171875}], "keywords": [{"score": 20, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 16, "name": "school"}, {"score": 16, "name": "students"}, {"score": 15, "name": "undergraduate"}, {"score": 11, "name": "occupying"}, {"score": 10, "name": "aymann"}, {"score": 10, "name": "animalnewyork"}, {"score": 10, "name": "commnniqu"}, {"score": 10, "name": "boarded-up"}, {"score": 8, "name": "cooper"}], "published": 1354617044000, "provider_name": "Animalnewyork", "type": "html"}
