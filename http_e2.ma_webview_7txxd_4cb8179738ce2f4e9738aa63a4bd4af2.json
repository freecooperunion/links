We maintain, as we have since the publication of  <a href=\"http://friendsofcooperunion.org/thewayforward/\">The Way Forward</a> in April 2012, that there are viable alternatives to charging tuition. We are confident that with a restoration of shared institutional governance, we can embark together upon a new path toward an ultimate reversal of the tuition decision.</p>\n<p><strong>The first step on that path is to build a better board of trustees. Alumni can begin to do that today.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vote  <a href=\"http://about.me/slavin\">Kevin Slavin</a>, A'95, into an alumni trustee position via write-in campaign during the current Cooper Union Alumni Association (CUAA) elections.</strong> Slavin is active, outspoken and clear about his position: he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zvx_Lazu1E\">supports and believes in a free Cooper Union</a> and opposes tuition. He is openly committed to seeking out alternatives. Even more importantly, he pledges to fulfill the true responsibility of the alumni trustee position and \"inform and deliver\" for his constituency, the alumni, who largely feel the current leadership of the CUAA does not represent their interests to the board. The CUAA-sanctioned candidate, Kathryn McGraw Berry, AR'80, does not publicly take a position on the debate of the future of Cooper Union, but in conversation supports tuition. Cooper cannot afford this status quo: vote for Slavin by following these steps:</p>\n<p>&#183;      register with the site (if you have not already)</p>\n<p>&#183;      login and click on the e-ballot link</p>\n<p>&#183;      write in \"Kevin Slavin\" for \"Alumni Trustee\"</p>\n<p>Theoretically, the CUAA should plays a critical role in the shared governance of Cooper Union. This position has real power and importance, and it belongs to us. So let's not waste this opportunity.</p>\n<p>Many current trustees reportedly voted against tuition, keeping the board in a deadlock for weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Let's send the trustees who support a free Cooper Union an ally right now.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Students for a Free Cooper Union</strong></p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 6, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 3, "name": "CUAA"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Kevin Slavin"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Slavin"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Kathryn McGraw Berry"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mark Epstein"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union Alumni Association"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper"}], "favicon_colors": null, "keywords": [{"score": 54, "name": "alumni"}, {"score": 47, "name": "trustees"}, {"score": 44, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 40, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 40, "name": "slavin"}, {"score": 30, "name": "union"}, {"score": 30, "name": "cuaa"}, {"score": 15, "name": "board"}, {"score": 14, "name": "position"}, {"score": 13, "name": "free"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "E2", "type": "html"}
