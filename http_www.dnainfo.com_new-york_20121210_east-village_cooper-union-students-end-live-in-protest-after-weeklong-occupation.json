After seven days, a small group of students from Cooper Union who had locked themselves inside the college in protest of a plan to charge tuition at the traditionally free school ended their \"live-in\" protest Monday.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121207/east-village/cooper-union-students-hold-live-in-protest-for-free-education\">Last week, 11 students from the cash-strapped Cooper Union barricaded themselves in the school's Foundation Building</a> and pledged to remain there until Cooper Union's administration promised to scrap plans to charge tuition and increase transparency to the student body.</p>\n<p>Although the school has officially met none of their demands, protesters claimed the live-in sparked enough media coverage and galvanized the rest of Cooper Union's student body to continue the battle out in the open.</p>\n<p>\"It was just one piece of a larger strategy,\" said live-in protester Casey Gollan, a 21-year-old senior in the School of Art. \"People felt like it was catalyzing to go up here,\" Gollan said, referring to the school's clock tower, where the live-in occurred.</p>\n<p>The protesters, which are part of the organizing body \"Students for a Free Cooper Union,\" made the decision to return from their stakeout above Cooper Square after hundreds of students and supporters attended a <a href=\"http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121208/east-village/cooper-union-students-march-keep-college-free-of-tuition\">Saturday rally,</a> according to Gollan.</p>\n<p>\"We came to realize that there is so much going on, we could plug into it,\" said another live-in protester Joe Riley, 22, a junior arts student at the school.</p>\n<p>Peter Cooper founded the school, which offers art, architecture and engineering degrees for both graduate and undergraduate students, in 1859, with the mission of a free education.</p>\n<p>Before 1902, when a large endowment was received, students who could pay for their tuition did, Cooper Union's press office said. After the endowment, all students were admitted with a full scholarship.</p>\n<p>Riley said no exact date had been set for the organizers' next protest, but he mentioned that students anticipated attending the school's traditionally private board meeting in January.</p>\n<p>\"There are things coming, I promise,\" he said, adding that a petition was already being passed around among the student body demanding official and permanent representation on the school's board.</p>\n<p>The school did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the live-in protesters came out, and it has yet to specify if any disciplinary action will be levied against the protesters.</p>\n<p>The live-in protesters began removing their barricade on Sunday.</p>\n<p>When the doors opened, they were met by some of the school's faculty in a gesture of support, they said.</p>\n<p>\"When I was a kid I didn't have access to education,\" said Cooper Union graphic design teacher Mike Essl, who graduated from the school in 1996. \"I applied [to Cooper Union] on a whim and literally a prayer, and that is how I do what I do today.\"</p>\n<p>He helped escort the live-in students from the clock tower, where they had camped out with supplies and sleeping bags.</p>\n<p>\"They have my thanks and gratitude,\" said Essl.</p>\n<p>The students were also met by some of their peers who had been supporting the live-in protesters from the ground, including by <a href=\"http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/students-disrupt-cooper-union-board-meeting-with-sobs-songs-plus-more-balloons/\">storming into the school's trustee meeting last Wednesday.</a></p>\n<p>Upon reaching ground level, Riley said he was happy the live-in protest was both a success and over.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to take a shower,\" he said, \"and then I am going to get back to my [school] work.\"</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 7, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Gollan"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Riley"}, {"count": 1, "name": "School of Art"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mike Essl"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Joe Riley"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Free Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Casey Gollan"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Essl"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [194, 35, 28], "weight": 0.03466796875}, {"color": [240, 236, 235], "weight": 0.02783203125}], "keywords": [{"score": 100, "name": "live-in"}, {"score": 58, "name": "students"}, {"score": 48, "name": "protest"}, {"score": 47, "name": "school"}, {"score": 44, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 30, "name": "union"}, {"score": 30, "name": "gollan"}, {"score": 20, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 20, "name": "essl"}, {"score": 20, "name": "riley"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Dnainfo", "type": "html"}
