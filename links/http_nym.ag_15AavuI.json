Well, that and summer and a rumor they would soon be arrested. The protesters <a href=\"http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=964ad2f631fe6f5f4389676d5&amp;id=7113d4f43f&amp;e=ec090d3d5b\">announced on Monday</a> that they had quietly vacated the office. They straightened up the furniture, washed the windows, and wiped down shelves before they left, one <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/16/nyregion/protesters-agree-to-vacate-top-office-at-cooper-union.html?ref=nyregion\">told the New York <i>Times</i></a>. The school agreed to create a working group \" <a href=\"http://cooper.edu/about/news/occupation-presidents-office-ends\">statement on Cooper's website</a> said. But the occupation of president Jamshed Bharucha's office might just have been at its natural end anyway.</p>\n<p>As the<em> Times</em> notes, the protesters' ranks had been \"thinned by summer,\" and occupier Joe Riley \"said the protesters had a different motivation to negotiate: they had been warned by third parties that if they did not cooperate, they would shortly be arrested.\" Bharucha didn't comment on that, saying only that arrest \"would have continued to be a last resort,\" the<em> Times</em> reports. And the school has said the students won't face any penalties for their sit-in.</p>\n<p>Bharucha, who only visited his office twice while the students occupied it, spoke to the<i> Times</i> from Rome to call the working group of students, faculty, and alumni a \"terrific resolution.\" So it's not like he's been pacing the hall waiting to be let in. He did drop by two weeks ago, \"motivated by a desire for closure before the start of his summer vacation,\" and started the negotiations that led to the working group deal. The protesters finalized that agreement with two trustees last Thursday, they <a href=\"http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=964ad2f631fe6f5f4389676d5&amp;id=7113d4f43f&amp;e=ec090d3d5b\">said in their statement</a>, and they've already <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion/status/356878671325302784\">gotten a space</a> to start their summer homework assignment: coming up with a way to keep paying zero tuition. They have until December to figure it out.</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 2, "name": "Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Rome"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York Times"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Joe Riley"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [39, 39, 39], "weight": 0.04541015625}, {"color": [221, 221, 221], "weight": 0.009033203125}, {"color": [143, 143, 143], "weight": 0.008056640625}], "keywords": [{"score": 30, "name": "bharucha"}, {"score": 20, "name": "protesters"}, {"score": 20, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 16, "name": "students"}, {"score": 16, "name": "occupied"}, {"score": 14, "name": "summer"}, {"score": 13, "name": "cooperate"}, {"score": 12, "name": "arrest"}, {"score": 11, "name": "office"}, {"score": 10, "name": "vacation"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Nymag", "type": "html"}
