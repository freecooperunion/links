In his repeated excoriations of Cooper's management he has conspicuously avoided prescribing an outcome to the standoff between the administration and Free Cooper Union, an omission that can be chalked up to something other than oversight.</p>\n<p>\"Basically they could make our lives a living hell by going through every dime spent on everything here,\" Peter Cafiero is alleged to have said in a decidedly different context than Monday's forum -  a closed-door Cooper trustee meeting on September 19, 2012 - and the incendiary implications of his comments have only fueled the outrage this week. The quote comes from a transcript leaked to Sydney Brownstone of the Village Voice, and her accompanying <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/05/cooper_union_secret_transcript.php\">story</a> this morning breathlessly lays out the most shocking exchanges, like the one above, that pepper the 42-page <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/703315-september-19-cooper-union-board-of-trustees.html#document/p30/a103811\">document</a>.</p>\n<p>Though the transcript is delivered with every incriminating pretext - the cloak-and-dagger deliberations of an overwhelmingly male cabal, the out-of-touch attitudes of the board members merit a broader understanding. Many private (and public) universities have increasingly surrendered strategic leadership to their part-time trustees, many of whom come from managerial or financial backgrounds and carry a certain MBA bravado about the entire enterprise of higher education. As suggested by the decision-making at Cooper, this anointed class considers trusteeship as more of a career trophy than a mantle of stewardship.</p>\n<p>And the effects of their rule have been particularly catastrophic, with university endowments, from  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/business/11harvard.html\">Harvard</a> on down, savaged by the financial crisis due to large holdings in alternative investments across a dizzying array of developed and emerging market private equity and hedge funds. The increased allocation of endowment funds in those risky asset classes - which ought to have been avoided entirely, as endowments are generally invested with long-term returns in mind - paralleled the increased influence of alternative investors on university boards.</p>\n<p>Cooper's board is fully symptomatic of every pathology inherent to such a managerial culture: a callous aloofness (Chairman Mark Epstein: \"Welcome to 1968... [laughter] Haven't been tear-gassed in decades.\") and open contempt for academia (Trustee and private equity investor <a href=\"http://www.generalcatalyst.com/entrepreneurs/stanley-lapidus\">Stanley Lapidus</a>: \"Their cushy ... jobs that are un-economic.\") If it all feels like a little bit of corporate stereotype slapstick, that's because it is, and it's as much the case on Cooper's board as it is on countless others. Which brings us back to the idea of Free Cooper Union's resistance, characterized by some critics as obstinate, yet functioning, hopefully, as a clarion call to the rest of higher education.</p>\n<p>What Jamshed Bharucha recently <a href=\"http://galleristny.com/2013/05/cooper-occupation-enters-third-week-with-protestors-administration-at-impasse/\">told</a> the  <em>New York Observer</em> captures much more than he meant to imply: \"Unless you're willing to actually sit and learn that complexity, it's quite natural to just get angry and assume something untoward is going on.\" At Cooper, the stakes were clearly defined, and Bharucha's regime flipped a historical binary switch, from no-tuition to tuition. It was a stark watershed moment, and untangling the web of mismanagement only fueled the outrage. For the rest of American higher education, the story was more subtle, and the cupidity of that managerial class has for decades delivered a familiar story - obscene tuition growth far outstripping inflation and public-private student loan cartels. And with those issues fully brought into the frame, Free Cooper Union's outrage should only be the beginning.</p>\n<em>At 8:00 pm EST tonight, members of Free Cooper Union will stage an interpretive reading of the leaked transcript. <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/free-cooper-union?utm_campaign=t.co&amp;utm_source=12757284&amp;utm_medium=social\">Tune in to their stream</a> then as they add some non-ironic comedic value to the document.</em> <em>Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified Kevin Slavin's position: he was elected Alumni Trustee, and John Leeper, not Slavin, is Peter Cafiero's successor as Alumni Association President.
