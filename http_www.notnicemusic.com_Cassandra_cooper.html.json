This plan is being referred to as the Working Group Plan. The process set up by Chair Mike Borkowsky, whereby a majority of ten members out of eighteen were needed for passage, effectively approved the plan.</p>\n<p>The charge of the Working Group was to submit by December 1 \"ways in which Cooper Union may revert to providing full-tuition scholarships for all enrolled students while establishing a sustainable financial model and continuing to invest in academic excellence.\" On December 3, four members of the Working Group changed their votes from abstensions to rejections, although the four have not provided an alternative plan that meets the charge. The three administrative representatives and a trustee appointed by Mark Epstein (former Chairman of the Board of Trustees) changed their votes.</p>\n<p>The Working Group made a presentation to the Board of Trustee Finance Committee and Executive Committee on December 4, 2013, which then held a second meeting on December 6, 2013, to discuss the Working Group Plan. On December 11, 2013, Mike Borkowsky and five other members of the Working Group made a presentation to the full Board.</p>\n<p>The Working Group Report was posted to the Cooper Union website the next day at <a href=\"http://cooper.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/assets/site/files/2013/WrkingGrpRpt_1212.pdf\">http://cooper.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/assets/site/files/2013/WrkingGrpRpt_1212.pdf</a>. New Board of Trustees Chairman Richard Lincer has promised a decision on whether to reverse the April 2013 board decision and adopt the Working Group Plan in mid-January 2014. Application deadlines are January 6, 2014, for the Schools of Art and Architecture and February 3, 2014, for the School of Engineering. Early decision applications due on December 2, 2013, were down 75%.</p>\n<p>An initial presentation to the Alumni Council by the alumni representatives to the Working Group was held on December 17, 2013.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/WG_BoTcom1.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/WG_BoTcom1.JPG\"></a><a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/WG_BoTcom2.JPG\"><img src=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/WG_BoTcom2.JPG\"></a></p>\n<p>Photos by Barry Drogin, click to enlarge, released to public domain with credit, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/baruch.skeer/media_set?set=a.362573407212473.1073741827.100003794505706&amp;type=1\">tagged on Facebook</a></p>\n\n<p>\n</p><h2><b>Working Group Plan Endorsements </b></h2>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cualumni.com/s/1289/index2.aspx?sid=1289&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=1175#CUAA\"><img src=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/cuaa.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p></p><center><b>Alumni Council Unanimous Resolution: </b></center><blockquote>\n<p>Resolved, on this the 17th day of December, 2013, the Council of the Cooper Union Alumni Association hereby endorses the Working Group proposal presented to the Cooper Union Board on December 11, 2013, to replace the imposition of tuition on the entering class in 2014 and subsequent undergraduate classes.

Outside of these entities, other entities have \"Cooper Union\" in their names: <a href=\"http://cusos.org/\">Free Cooper Union</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/register/follow/free-cooper-union\">tumblr</a> blog, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion\">Twitter</a> feed, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FreeCooperUnion\">Facebook</a> page, and a public salon that traveled to <a href=\"http://thewhitebuilding.org.uk/whats-on/public-assembly-an-alternative-summer-show/\">London</a>, <a href=\"http://www.friendsofcooperunion.org/\">Friends of Cooper Union</a>, the <a href=\"http://cooperuniontaskforce.com/wiki/tiki-index.php\">Cooper Union Task Force</a> wiki, Cooper Union's three unions, and, of course, the <a href=\"http://www.cualumni.com/s/1289/index2.aspx?pgid=343&amp;gid=1\">Cooper Union Alumni Association</a> (CUAA).</p>\n<p>The last of these, during the last financial crisis, signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the college, establishing elected representatives to the Board of Trustees and representation on faculty committees. The Memorandum, signed by the President of the college and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees in February 1974 and taking effect on July 1, 1974, also subject all employees of the Alumni Office (merging the Alumni Association office and the Office of Alumni Relations) to approval by the Council of the Alumni Association (replacing the Alumni Association Board of Governors), and gave the Alumni Association \"full responsibility for the Alumni Fund and all alumni activities\" and empowered it to \"direct the operation of the Alumni Office.\"</p>\n<p>With the most recent financial crisis, the Alumni Association has pushed to restore its powers. Back in November 2011, a staff member of the Alumni Office quelched an e-mail to the CUAA membership announcing the December 2011 Community Summit; recently, the CUAA Council voted to sponsor a <a href=\"http://cooper.edu/events-and-exhibitions/events/free-discussion-ethics-law-and-surveillance-culture\">Great Hall event on surveillance</a> and a booth at the <a href=\"http://fabnyc.org/FAB_Festival.php\">Fourth Street Arts Block FAB! Festival</a>. The recent slate of CUAA Council representatives, as well as its new President and a write-in alumni trustee to start serving in December 2013, are leading actions to reverse or delay the April 2013 tuition announcement, and the Council has established an ad hoc committee to establish the Associates of The Cooper Union, an organization described in the college's Charter which never came into being and, amongst its various powers, has the right to remove trustees.</p>\n<p>Assuming ignorance of the Memorandum, Cooper administrators are seeking to establish new policies and procedures that dilute the powers of alumni. The Alumni Office has established \"affinity groups\" which operate outside of the Council and its events committee, held \"regional\" events outside of the Council's core New York City constituency (with limited propaganda success), and is now trying to stop all outside organizations from fundraising activities without the Alumni Office's approval. CUAA ID cards are no longer being issued, and access to the Cooper Union library is now by appointment only.</p>\n<p>As with other recent Cooper \"policies,\" many of these are simply being ignored, as were disciplinary actions and access issues during the Spring 2013 Sit-In. Saying that relations between the Council and the Alumni Office are strained would be putting it mildly. The new activist Council is likely to re-establish its power to \"direct\" the Alumni Office in the months ahead.</p>\n\n<p></p><center><b>Alumni Giving Part II: The \"Regular Contributor\" and Other Myths </b> </center><center><a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/giving2.pdf\"><img src=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/percent_years.jpg\"></a></center><p>It's not that alumni <i>don't</i> give, it's that, some years, alumni <i>can't</i> give.

He pledged to attempt \"a united effort to get the school back on track,\" and said the Working Group would put on the table \"a much more extensive set of cost reductions [so] we will know once and for all if the community has the willingness to fight for [restoring the full scholarship] and make the sacrifices that they have to make or to help us accomplish it.\" In recorded comments and responses at the July CUAA Council Meeting that were livestreamed, Mr. Borkowsky admitted that the trustees had previously taken a lot of measures \"off the table\" as unlikely.</p>\n \n</div>\n<p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>This content has been moved to a <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/Cassandra/cooper_news_archive.html\">news archive</a>: <b>New CUAA President and Executive Committee Hit the Ground Running, Administration Embarks on Summer Hiring Spree, June 2013 State of the Union, Free Saturday Program Wins Reprieve with $1,000,000 Trustee Donation, Statement from adjunct faculty, Short-term \"Solution\" Used to Force Long-Term \"Solution,\" Half-Decades of Non-Income Assets (construction loans), New Anti-Tuition Alumni Trustee/New President Salary/Free 154 Years/40% Alumni Giving: \"Oh shit.\", Bharucha Calls for Healing, but Epstein Threatens Extinction, Joint Statement from the Leadership of CUFCT, CUOP, and U@CU, Cooper Undergraduate Education: Eighty Thousand Dollars, Is Peter Cooper History?, Clueless Students Obscure Friends of Cooper Union Message, Pearson Molds Propaganda Campaign</b></p>\n<div>\n<p></p><p>When the financial crisis was first announced, Litia Perta wrote an articulate, contextualizing article for <i>The Brooklyn Rail</i> that lucidly expressed for all the various underpinnings of the situation.

Then came <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/counter-narratives.pdf\">Counter-Narratives to the Administration Narrative</a>, followed by <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/questions.pdf\">Questions answered by Chair Epstein</a>. By this time, <i>The Alumni Pioneer</i> was born.</p>\n<p>The first version of <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/scenarios.pdf\">Scenarios for End Times</a> followed next, then <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/Fee_v_Tuition.pdf\">Fee vs. Tuition</a>, along with <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/2007_strategy.pdf\">Cooper's Strategy through 2007</a>, written by Don Toman, former Alumni Association President. Finally, the first analyses, <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/payroll.pdf\">Cooper Payroll - The Monkey on Their Back</a> (and its <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/people.xls\">spreadsheet</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/board.pdf\">Trustees Mainly Board Junkies</a> (and its <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/board.xls\">spreadsheet</a>), were published.</p>\n<p>The Thanksgiving break was a major time for <i>The Alumni Pioneer</i>, with the initial publication of <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/deficit.pdf\">Do You Want Deficit With That?</a> (and its <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/deficit.xls\">spreadsheet</a>). At the end of the long weekend, <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/bharucha.pdf\">The Real Bharucha</a> was published. Within a week the two had garnered over 400 downloads each.</p>\n<p>On Monday we changed tack with the inspiring <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/voices.pdf\">Cooper Voices</a> and published <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/relations.pdf\">questions the Office of Public Relations refused to answer</a> when, given three days to respond, well, the Office of Public Relations refused to respond to our questions.</p>\n<p>We posted <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/deadline.pdf\">The Deadline</a> on the morning of the <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/Drogin_Financial.pps\">Great Hall Financial presentation</a> on December 5, 2011. ( <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/Drogin_Financial_silent.pps\">Silent</a> and <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/Drogin_Financial.pdf\">PDF</a> versions were posted two days later, and <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/slides.pdf\">Selected Community Summit Slides</a> two days after that).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jamshedbharucha.com/\">Dr. Bharucha</a> enjoyed reading our publisher's <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/fantasy.pdf\">Fantasy Presidential Address</a>, but laughed it off. We took a snapshot of the <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/poll.pdf\">Urtak Poll</a>. The Board stayed on schedule and published their December 16 report on the financial crisis. This led the Cooper Union Community to the 2006 <i>cy pres</i> petition to the NYS Supreme Court. The false optimism of the fantasy presidential address has been replaced with the stark realities of the administration's <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/incompetence.pdf\">Fiduciary Timeline</a> and an attempt to analyze the Board Statement and Summary while they continue to play <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/salami.pdf\">Hide the Salami</a>.</p>\n<p>Just before the holiday break, the Gang of Six posted their summary of the Community Summit and announced a second set of breakout sessions, so we published a <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/summit_sum.pdf\">Summary of the Summary</a> for those with really short attention spans - although we certainly encourage our readers to read the original summary, read the full transcripts, and watch the videos, if you are so inclined. Over that break we didn't sit still: we created a a <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/relations2.pdf\">new set of questions that the Office of Public Relations also refused to answer</a>, we wrote about administrators who, through their actions, end up <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/story.pdf\">Becoming the Story</a>, and we created a song and slideshow based on <a href=\"http://jamshedbharucha.com/\">Bharucha</a>'s \"reinvention strategy\" called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ3l8lmxyI0\">The New Colossus</a>.</p>\n<p>We explain the Higher Education Price Index in <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/HEPI.pdf\">Don't Worry, Be HEPI</a>, and created some fantastic <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/Infographics.pdf\">infographics</a> in time for the third Breakout Session. We've changed our masthead slogan twice: now it's \"Fighting For a Fair Risk-Free Austerity Budget Since November 2011.\" Prior to publication of \"The Way Forward,\" we called for layoffs and program reductions in <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/austerity.pdf\">Envisioning Austerity</a>. We all know what happened on April 24, 2012 - the pre-emptive surrender called the \"hybrid framework\" is analyzed in <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/chess.pdf\">See the Whole Board</a>. And to wrap up the first academic year of the crisis, we offered <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/philanthropy.pdf\">Endow a President</a>, our slightly tongue-in-cheek guide to how the New Philanthropy can actually benefit The Cooper Union.</p>\n<p>The second year of the crisis, TC Westcott responded to our <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/canbgkt\">Student's Guide to the Cooper Union Financial Crisis</a> with her FAQ, so we created a list of <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/AQAF.pdf\">Actual Questions Asked Frequently</a>. We had just written a critique of <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/RCM.pdf\">Responsibility Centered Management</a> when the first lock-in on December 3, 2012, made everything get very busy. For the general public, we published our <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/New_York_Mag.pdf\">New York Magazine-style article</a> for non-Cooper folk. We responded to clueless engineering students with <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/claus.pdf\">Yes, Alexander, There Is A Santa Claus</a> and discovered historical documents that revealed some inconvenient truths about <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/cooper.pdf\">The Real Cooper</a>. The clueless engineering students took offense on-line, so we set up a <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/facebook.pdf\">Facebook Policy</a> that we occasionally ease up on when the offending parties take a break to attend to classes and exams. In response to the constant refrain to offer alternatives to tuition, we posted a summary of <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/solutions.pdf\">Solutions</a> from <i>The Alumni Pioneer</i> and Friends of Cooper Union.</p>\n<p>Over winter break, we decided to go musical again with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N35kqNDY--o\">The Education of Mark Epstein</a> (also available as a <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/education.pdf\">PDF</a>). Prior to a March 1, 2013, stand-off, <i>The Alumni Pioneer</i> offered <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/two.pdf\">A Tale of Two Coopers</a>.</p>\n<p>We thought it would be over, but then came the tuition announcement and the May 8, 2013 sit-in. Mark Bokowsky kicked off that March 1 event, and was the first trustee to visit the sit-in, so we looked in our archives and published \"the Borkowsky letter\" and a critique of the 20% alumni giving lie in <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/giving.pdf\">Michael Borkowsky and Alumni Giving</a>. This has been followed by a more in-depth statistical analysis based on the FY 2009 Donor Report, <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/giving2.pdf\">The \"Regular Contributor\" and Other Myths</a>. The tuition announcement, horrible as it is, is a distraction from the total abandonment of the merit scholarships, as described in <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/new_cooper.pdf\">Drinking the Kool-Aid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/donut.pdf\">Coffee, Donut, and a Dorm</a>.</p>\n<p>In response to more false narratives posted on the Cooper Union website, <i>The Alumni Pioneer</i> has created two YouTube videos, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/eNFZvNC1Hgw\">Ask Mr. Misinformation</a> and <a href=\"http://youtu.be/hlF7VEaA8CU\">The Politics of Distraction</a>, as well as <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/narrative.pdf\">The Real Narrative</a>. Also, <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/chair.pdf\">selection of a new Chairman of the Board of Trustees</a> is scheduled for September 2013.</p>\n<p>If this is too much, check out the lighter fare on <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/Cassandra/cooper2.html\">Page 2</a> and a serial webcomic, <a href=\"http://www.notnicemusic.com/Cassandra/cooper3.html\">Peter Cooper &amp; The Demons of Debt</a>.
