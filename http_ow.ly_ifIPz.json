Acceptance into any college is very often accompanied by a great deal of praise from one's family and friends. The journey through college itself is usually a life-changing experience as well for most students. It brings about a development of character, a new set of responsibilities, a feeling of independence and it helps to further chart the course of one's life after school; as it opens the door to higher income levels.</p>\n<p>The decision of what schools to apply to is therefore a very serious one which few students take lightly. Applicants can spend months researching which schools offer the curriculum which best fits their interests. Sometimes the drive to attend a particular school can result in years of focus, preparation and the maintenance of high marks.</p>\n<p>As the time spent preparing to apply to particular schools requires such devotion; rejection from a desired school can often break an applicant's spirit. This is especially the case with early decision applicants.</p>\n<p>What makes an early decision application different from a regular application is you can only apply to one school for early decision. As the student can only apply to one school, they are obviously showing a great deal more interest in this school as opposed to others they may apply to later. As they are applying at an earlier stage of the applications process it is common courtesy for the school to send a letter of acceptance or rejection when the applications process says it will. It is also a matter of principle for the school to do so in order to maintain its integrity in the eyes of the applicant.</p>\n<p>In the case of the early applicants to Cooper Union for the fall semester, they weren't even rejected. Instead they are just being held in limbo as they were told to wait for a response to their early decision application in late March. When did they expect to receive a response to their early decision application? At the beginning of February. (See <a href=\"http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130220/east-village/cooper-union-students-protest-delayed-early-admissions-amid-tuition-fight\">source</a> article.)</p>\n<p>This is not the first time in recent history the Cooper Union Administration has ignored principle either. The school is about to vote on a decision as to whether or not it will begin charging tuition for new students. Why is tuition a loss of principle? The institution was founded on the principle of free education through admission based solely on merit.</p>\n<p>The situation becomes even worse for the early decision applicants because deferment is the result of a dispute which they had no involvement in. A quorum of teachers from the School of Art, respecting school tradition of free merit-based eduction, refused to charge tuition as a means of generating revenue.</p>\n<p>Taken from a statement from the Cooper Union:</p>\n<p>\"The art school prepared a plan, but a quorum of the school's faculty, several days later, attached a post-script preventing the plan from being considered, saying the School of Art Faculty 'opposes the very principle of generating revenue through tuition from academic programs,' including summer school or graduate programs. That course is unsustainable.\" (See <a href=\"http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/cooper-union/\">source</a> article)</p>\n<p>The greatest irony in this is the early decision applicants are being deferred because the teachers of the Cooper Union Art School chose to uphold the founding principles of the school. President Jamshed Bharucha did ask the other two Schools of Architecture and Engineering to submit revenue generating plans as well, and the faculties of those two schools submitted revenue-generating plans as requested. </p>\n<p>It's important to note a very serious complaint the students have had with the Cooper Union Administration, and President Bharucha, is the lack of transparency which has been provided as to where school funding goes. A betrayal of school principles (in the creation of a tuition) may now be committed by the Administration while a lack of transparency is provided as to the reasons for why this betrayal needs to take place at all. A vote this month will determine whether or not a tuition is implemented which could end the Cooper Union's historic tradition of free merit-based education.</p>\n<p>The result of this battle is an unfair position for the applicants applying for early admission. They have been turned into collateral through an Administrative feud simply because they happened to apply for enrollment at the wrong time in Cooper Union's history.</p>\n<p>In response to these early decision deferrals a press conference was held in front of the Cooper Union's foundation building on February 20th, and statements from deferred early decision applicants were read:</p>\n<a href=\"http://stopmotionsolo.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20_13-07-16_796.jpg\"><img src=\"http://stopmotionsolo.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20_13-07-16_796-224x300.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"http://stopmotionsolo.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20_13-07-42_890.jpg\"><img src=\"http://stopmotionsolo.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20_13-07-42_890-300x224.jpg\"></a> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29431018/highlight/328432\">opening statement</a> of the press conference.</p>\n<p>A statement is read on <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29431018/highlight/328433\">behalf of the Art Student Council of Cooper Union.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29431018/highlight/328435\">Owen Law</a> reads a statement about his deferral.</p>\n<a href=\"http://stopmotionsolo.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20_13-19-38_160.jpg\"><img src=\"http://stopmotionsolo.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20_13-19-38_160-225x300.jpg\"></a> <p><a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29431018/highlight/328436\">Jillian Dolan</a> reads a statement about her deferral.</p>\n<a href=\"http://stopmotionsolo.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20_13-21-22_521.jpg\"><img src=\"http://stopmotionsolo.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-20_13-21-22_521-225x300.jpg\"></a> <p>Another <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/29431018/highlight/328439\">statement</a> is read.
