In these turbulent times, her departure is cause for alarm and sadness in the the Cooper Union Community. As we say goodbye and wish her mother good health, we must also act to ensure that her replacement can live up to the challenges ahead. Most pressingly, the community must demand that the administration's participation in the Gural/Borkowsky Working Group be as forthcoming about the financial picture as TC would have been.</p>\n<p>Among her many virtues as Vice President for Finance and Administration, TC demonstrated a commitment to engaging in open and respectful dialogue with community members. She was indispensable in her understanding of Cooper's financial circumstances. Above all, her position as an administrator was distinguished by her integrity and sincerity. We will remember in particular how TC entered the occupation of the president's office to ensure police were not brought in to arrest the occupying students.<br><br> Thank you, TC, for all of your hard work and for benefitting this Institution. You will be sorely missed.</p>\n<p><br><a href=\"http://www.friendsofcooperunion.org/thankyou-tc/\"><img src=\"http://cache-02.cleanprint.net/media/pfviewer/images/CleanPrintIcn_16x16.png\"></a><a href=\"http://www.friendsofcooperunion.org/thankyou-tc/\"><img src=\"http://cache-02.cleanprint.net/media/pfviewer/images/PdfIcn_16x16.png\"></a> </p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 2, "name": "Finance and Administration"}, {"count": 2, "name": "TC"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union Community"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "TC Westcott"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [249, 248, 121], "weight": 0.837646484375}, {"color": [134, 136, 17], "weight": 0.162353515625}], "keywords": [{"score": 13, "name": "administrator"}, {"score": 10, "name": "westcott"}, {"score": 10, "name": "gural"}, {"score": 10, "name": "focu"}, {"score": 10, "name": "community"}, {"score": 10, "name": "borkowsky"}, {"score": 8, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 8, "name": "finance"}, {"score": 8, "name": "ensure"}, {"score": 8, "name": "2013"}], "published": 1376265600000, "provider_name": "Friendsofcooperunion", "type": "html"}
