They stayed in varying numbers, but everyone has now vacated that office in exchange for an invitation to join alumni, administrators, faculty members and trustees in a joint search for a different way out of the school's financial crisis.</p>\n<p>In addition, the leadership of the school promised an alternate space in which students could gather and strategize, and it confirmed its intention to welcome a student representative onto the board of trustees. It would not penalize the protesters for their actions, the school said. The students, for their part, agreed to comply with Cooper Union policies in the future.</p>\n<p>\"It's an opportunity for faculty, alumni and students to be involved to have a real say in how to keep the school free that we haven't seen before,\" said Joe Riley, a student who had been active in the occupation. \"It's exciting and I'm glad we were able to get to that agreement.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Bharucha, speaking from Rome, agreed: \"I think it's a terrific resolution and we look forward to implementing it.\"</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, Dr. Bharucha paid a visit to his office - only his second since the occupation began - in hopes of finding a resolution. He said he was motivated by a desire for closure before the start of his summer vacation. Mr. Riley said the protesters had a different motivation to negotiate: they had been warned by third parties that if they did not cooperate, they would shortly be arrested. (Dr. Bharucha declined to comment on that rumor, saying only that arrest \"would have continued to be a last resort.\")</p>\n<p>Also present at that meeting were two trustees, Jeffrey Gural and Michael Borkowsky. \"We made it clear to the students that we all agree that it's desirable to keep the school tuition free,\" Mr. Gural said. He added: \"Even if we can't find a solution, it's important that the Cooper community feel that every effort was made to find one.\"</p>\n<p>In the past, Dr. Bharucha has insisted that undergraduate tuition, to be assessed on a sliding scale with a top fee of $20,000, was the only possible way to keep Cooper Union's art, architecture and engineering schools open. But he said he was open to the findings of the new <a href=\"http://cooper.edu/about/news/occupation-presidents-office-ends\">working group</a>, which would be presented to the trustees by Dec. 1. </p>\n<p>As for the occupiers, Mr. Riley said they did not all agree about the proper course of action. Coming and going largely as they pleased, they had turned an elegantly understated administrative office into a hive of creative activity and emerged as an unlikely inspiration to protest movements around the globe. But with their ranks thinned by summer, he said, they decided to move to the next phase of activist engagement. So last Friday evening, the students picked up their belongings and left.</p>\n<p>\"We washed all the windows, scrubbed all the shelves,\" Mr. Riley said. \"We rearranged some of the furniture so it was actually a more efficient use of the space.\"</p>\n<p>Dr. Bharucha has yet to see it. Two months of exile had ended, but he said he was too busy preparing for his vacation the next morning to reclaim the space as his own.</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 5, "name": "Dr. Bharucha"}, {"count": 4, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 3, "name": "Riley"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Joe Riley"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jeffrey Gural"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Gural"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Rome"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Michael Borkowsky"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [3, 3, 3], "weight": 0.525634765625}, {"color": [243, 243, 243], "weight": 0.0224609375}, {"color": [120, 120, 120], "weight": 0.014404296875}], "keywords": [{"score": 60, "name": "bharucha"}, {"score": 33, "name": "students"}, {"score": 27, "name": "trustees"}, {"score": 27, "name": "riley"}, {"score": 26, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 20, "name": "gural"}, {"score": 20, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 20, "name": "schools"}, {"score": 17, "name": "occupation"}, {"score": 16, "name": "vacation"}], "published": 1373846400000, "provider_name": "Nytimes", "type": "html"}
