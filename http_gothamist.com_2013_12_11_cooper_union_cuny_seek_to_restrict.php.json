The regulations are even more stringent than Cooper Union's:</p>\n<blockquote>A draft from June declared free speech and assembly to be subject to the needs for public order. It would restrict gatherings and the distribution of leaflets to approved areas and times and would forbid faculty members from taking part in protests during working hours. Sponsors of planned protests with as few as 25 students would have to give at least 24 hours' notice of location, date, time and expected turnout, subject to the college's approval or alteration.</blockquote>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 7, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "CUNY"}, {"count": 1, "name": "City College"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mark Epstein"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Challenge For Modernity"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York Times"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York"}, {"count": 1, "name": "David Petraeus"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [229, 229, 229], "weight": 0.000244140625}, {"color": [49, 49, 49], "weight": 0.000244140625}], "keywords": [{"score": 31, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 26, "name": "union"}, {"score": 17, "name": "cuny"}, {"score": 16, "name": "protests"}, {"score": 14, "name": "restrict"}, {"score": 14, "name": "forbid"}, {"score": 13, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 13, "name": "faculty"}, {"score": 12, "name": "students"}, {"score": 11, "name": "campus"}], "published": 1386730320000, "provider_name": "Gothamist", "type": "html"}
