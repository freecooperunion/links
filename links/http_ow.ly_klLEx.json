At about 4 p.m., students milled around a coffee cart that the school's Coffee Club had wheeled out and kicked around a ball in front of a large red sign that had been strung up, reading \"Free Education to all.\"</p>\n<p>\"The students and faculty feel that the board of trustees don't understand what really makes this school special,\" said Jaime Babon, 21, an architecture student who said that he could not have afforded to come to Cooper Union had the school charged tuition when he enrolled. \"This was a place where your financial status didn't matter.\"</p>\n<p>\"The kinds of people that this place draws are truly inspiring,\" added Alex Goss, 21, an art student. \"I don't know if that will be the same in 2014.\"</p>\n<p>\"It feels like we're being turned into a school like every other school in the world,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Cooper Union - named after founder and industrialist Peter Cooper - was established in 1859 as a school for low-income students, offering access to the higher education necessary to participate in shaping public life. Since then, the promise of free education has been as central to the school's identity as its rigorous programs in architecture, engineering, and the arts, as well as its motley collection of academic buildings - architectural marvels suggestive of the talent of the students inside.</p>\n<p>But, like colleges and universities across the country, the college has hit hard financial times in recent years. While the school has relied largely on rent income from land beneath the Chrysler Building to fund its scholarships, that source has not kept pace with inflation rates, Epstein said in his statement.</p>\n<p>The new payment scheme will not affect current undergraduates and will also not apply to new students enrolling in the fall of 2013. The college will also remain need-blind and will continue to offer additional scholarships to applicants with financial need, including full tuition grants to all Pell Grant-eligible students, Epstein said.</p>\n<p>The college had previously considered budget cuts as an alternative to charging undergraduate tuition. But those cuts would have meant closing at least one of the college's colleges, and other, less drastic measures, like lowering enrollment, would not have been substantial enough to close a projected $12 million annual deficit, Epstein said.</p>\n<p>\"Under the new policy, The Cooper Union will continue to adhere to the vision of Peter Cooper, who founded the institution specifically to provide a quality education to those who might otherwise not be able to afford it,\" said Epstein. \"Our priorities have been and will continue to be quality and access, so that we will remain a true meritocracy of outstanding students from all socio-economic backgrounds.\"</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 8, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 4, "name": "Epstein"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jaime Babon"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Paris"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Board of Trustees"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mark Epstein"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Paul Lahana"}, {"count": 1, "name": "France"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Coffee Club"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Pell Grant-eligible"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Alex Goss"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union Great Hall"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [195, 37, 29], "weight": 0.031494140625}, {"color": [243, 244, 242], "weight": 0.031005859375}], "keywords": [{"score": 83, "name": "students"}, {"score": 49, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 46, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 44, "name": "school"}, {"score": 39, "name": "epstein"}, {"score": 34, "name": "union"}, {"score": 28, "name": "enrollment"}, {"score": 25, "name": "scholarships"}, {"score": 23, "name": "colleges"}, {"score": 21, "name": "architectural"}], "published": 1366698300000, "provider_name": "Dnainfo", "type": "html"}
