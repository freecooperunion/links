They are occupying and fighting to save free education at Cooper and to demand radical changes to the way it is governed. This is a landmark struggle, and we support it. </em> <p>We write to you to express our solidarity with your struggle to maintain free education at Cooper Union. In England, we had free undergraduate tuition until 15 years ago, when the Labour (social-democratic) Party introduced tuition fees. Then came 'top-up fees' in 2003, and from this year the Conservative-Liberal coalition has imposed undergraduate tuition fees of &#163;9,000 (~$14,500) a year, with graduate courses and fees for international students often double that. This is a huge and rapid transition: funding for higher education has passed from the state to the debt-laden individual; education is now a commodity to buy, a loan taken out against (increasingly unlikely) future earnings, a commodity defined by its impact on the economy rather than contribution to society. University applications are down by 10% this year, as the young, the poor, those with dependents, and the sensible, baulk at accumulating &#163;60,000 debt, including living costs, for an undergraduate degree.</p>\n<p>In this same time we have seen the growth of the managerial, neo-liberal university administrations that view colleges as businesses, students as consumers, overseas students as cash cows, teachers as exploitable labour, and cleaners as a marginal service workforce to be farmed out to greedy contractors. UCL management are right now in negotiations to demolish a housing estate in Stratford to build a new campus, destroying the local community.</p>\n<p>The student movement in the UK has not been good enough at articulating a radical vision for free education. At every juncture, our \"leaders\" fought for the status quo, and this is where we find ourselves. Our experience is that making radical principled demands, not moderated ones, is the only way to oppose neo-liberal economic policies in education. Never give up the fight. You have the students and the academics with you; who else is there?</p>\n<p>(This is a preliminary list of signatories.
