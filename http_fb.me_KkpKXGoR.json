Similar Statements of No Confidence are currently in the process of being drafted and voted upon by the School of Architecture and the School of Engineering.</p>\n<p>On April 23, 2013, Cooper Union's board of trustees announced that they will begin <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/nyregion/cooper-union-to-charge-undergraduates-tuition.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">charging tuition</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union\">ending the university's 144-year-old mission of providing free education to all those who merited entry.</a> The decision was met with a united uproar of dissent from nearly all sectors of the university community, including students, faculty, and alumni. While it might seem counterintuitive to get behind a relatively small struggle at one of the most exclusive universities in the country-an old-fashioned meritocracy in a world in which a young person's \"potential\" is directly proportionate to their family's economic station-Cooper Union is by far the most diverse of all elite colleges: white students are a minority here and two-thirds of the student body attended public high schools.</p>\n<p>Institutions funded by philanthropy and real estate earnings are clearly unsustainable as foundations for a quality education, but the school's economic problems and its board's regressive solutions mirror the situation currently taking place at countless other universities, both public and private. From CUNY tuition hikes to the <a href=\"http://www.psc-cuny.org/clarion/january-2013/middle-states-commission-warns-medgar-evers-college-over-accreditation\">torpedoing of Medgar Evers College</a> to NYU's <a href=\"http://nyunews.com/2013/04/10/protest-3/\">unprecedented land grab</a>, students across the city are fighting back. As student struggles continue across the globe, Cooper Union is a flashpoint for something much larger than itself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cooper\">Peter Cooper,</a> the school's founder, railed against the scourge of student debt a century and a half before the streets of Montreal exploded with resistance, before New York universities faced a string of militant occupations, before students in California put their bodies on the line against tuition hikes and the commodification of higher education. The ongoing fight at Cooper Union is but one part of the broader struggle against austerity, debt, and all other symptoms of capitalism.</p>\n<p>On May 1, a 36-page mini-zine that serves as a postscript to last year's <em><strong><a href=\"http://year0.org/2012/12/04/why-is-cooper-union-being-occupied/\">Why is Cooper Union Being Occupied?</a></strong></em> was produced and distributed around the city.
