Full tuition for the 2012-13 school year was $38,550.</p>\n<p>The trustees voted last week to charge students after deliberating over 18 months to figure out how to close a mounting budget gap.

When running the numbers, he said the school found an unusual problem: It couldn't analyze what percentage of current students would need financial aid because it usually didn't bother asking students about their family's financial situation.</p>\n<p>The school has a projected $12 million annual deficit and is facing rising expenses, such as health-care costs that are increasing 7.5% annually, Mr. Epstein said. Some assets, such as the Chrysler Building, have helped sustain the university to some extent. But Mr. Epstein said even with rent increases after 2019, the rate of growth wouldn't keep up with inflation.</p>\n<p>The school has drawn from investments and fundraising to provide tuition-free education for about 1,000 students. For years, trustees said, the school hired presidents for their academic credentials, not their fund-raising prowess.</p>\n<p>In a tense and at times hostile meeting with students and faculty members, Mr. Epstein took written questions about the decision.</p>\n<p>\"This format of asking questions is insulting,\" complained one person in the audience. Mr. Epstein responded: \"Maybe so. Being yelled at, like the last meeting, was offensive.\"</p>\n<p>Students and faculty members at the meeting Tuesday worried that some high-quality students would choose other schools if Cooper Union began charging tuition. \"If people are coming here merely because we're free,\" Mr. Epstein replied, \"we're doing something wrong.\"</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 8, "name": "Epstein"}, {"count": 3, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mark Epstein"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "East Village"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Manhattan"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Don Blauweiss"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [187, 180, 160], "weight": 0.453125}, {"color": [226, 225, 217], "weight": 0.3603515625}, {"color": [111, 113, 112], "weight": 0.136474609375}, {"color": [38, 40, 39], "weight": 0.050048828125}], "keywords": [{"score": 70, "name": "epstein"}, {"score": 54, "name": "students"}, {"score": 40, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 40, "name": "schools"}, {"score": 27, "name": "trustees"}, {"score": 23, "name": "charging"}, {"score": 20, "name": "tuition-free"}, {"score": 20, "name": "faculty"}, {"score": 17, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 13, "name": "free"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Wsj", "type": "html"}
