I think they've been put in a really weird place. I can't see them trying to defend these weird balances of power for much longer.\"</p>\n<p>Gollan also explained that the group didn't want to expend all of its energy in one go:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have a strategy going forward, which isn't to burn out on one action. We had a solidarity statement from students in Mexico who had occupied their school for <em>nine months</em>. Our demands still stand, and some of them we can fulfill ourselves, and some of them we're starting to see cracks in the administration's confidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He said that the occupiers were encouraged by student-organized  <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/61635/cooper-union-responds-to-occupation-during-supporters-day-of-action/\">actions and protests on the ground</a> during the week of the clock tower occupation, not least of which is the potential reorganization of the student government. \"The way that students govern themselves right now is pretty standard, but we came down today and someone on the student council said, 'We have to dissolve everything and create this new structure.'\"</p>\n<p>That new structure is called a spokescouncil, diagrammed in the picture above. Gollan said it was a new idea for him and the other occupiers, but they're excited about it. \"Cooper has a lot of people with different opinions, so it's been hard to get people excited and organized. So a spokescouncil breaks people down into a structure where people can work on stuff. This all happened in the last week, and now we'll be coming down and plugging into this.\"</p>\n<p>Gollan said the Cooper Union group is gaining momentum from being in touch with people at InterOccupy, the group organizing and running the <a href=\"http://interoccupy.net/occupysandy/\">Occupy Sandy</a> hurricane relief effort, as well as individuals at the City University of New York (CUNY) about possible joint initiatives between the two schools. And he added that the Cooper Union occupation was a success simply in terms of how long it went on: the students' barricade was rammed by maintenance not long after they holed up in the clock tower, and they thought they would be evicted after a mere 20 minutes. Instead, they lasted a week, they decided was long enough.</p>\n<p>\"I think ultimately it's a longer-term project than this occupation, which is just one action,\" Gollan said.</p>\n<p>Tagged as: <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/casey-gollan/\">Casey Gollan</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/cooper-union/\">Cooper Union</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/education/\">education</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/protests/\">protests</a></p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 5, "name": "Gollan"}, {"count": 4, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Casey Gollan"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mexico"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Hyperallergic"}, {"count": 1, "name": "City University of New York"}, {"count": 1, "name": "CUNY"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [59, 66, 72], "weight": 0.033447265625}, {"color": [30, 184, 237], "weight": 0.016357421875}, {"color": [87, 133, 153], "weight": 0.0126953125}], "keywords": [{"score": 70, "name": "gollan"}, {"score": 27, "name": "occupy"}, {"score": 25, "name": "students"}, {"score": 22, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 22, "name": "occupation"}, {"score": 20, "name": "spokescouncil"}, {"score": 16, "name": "tower"}, {"score": 15, "name": "clock"}, {"score": 15, "name": "union"}, {"score": 13, "name": "structure"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Hyperallergic", "type": "html"}
