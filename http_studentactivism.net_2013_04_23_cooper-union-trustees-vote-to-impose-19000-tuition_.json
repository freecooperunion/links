According to  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CooperTaskForce\">tweets from meeting attendees</a> with the  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CooperTaskForce\">Cooper Union Task Force</a> and  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion\">Free Cooper Union</a>, the tuition charge will replace the college's longstanding automatic 100% scholarships for all students with a new 50% scholarship. Since the college's  official tuition rate is <a href=\"http://cooper.edu/admissions/tuition-fees\">$19,275 a semester</a> for 2012-13, new students can expect to be charged at least that much beginning next year.</p>\n<p>The New York Times reported this afternoon that a consulting firm hired by Cooper Union last year <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/nyregion/cooper-union-to-charge-undergraduates-tuition.html?pagewanted=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">advised against cutting the scholarships by more than 25%</a>, concluding that a tuition rate above $10,000 a year would drive away desired applicants and raise students' expectations regarding amenities. The  board rejected this advice, <a href=\"http://studentactivism.net/2012/12/12/how-tuition-hurts-colleges/\">which mirrors arguments I made last fall</a>, on the grounds that a 75% scholarship rate would not produce sufficient revenue to balance Cooper Union's books.</p>\n<p>At today's meeting Epstein said that Cooper Union admissions would remain need-blind, and that about a quarter of 2014 admittees would receive full scholarships. As much as half of the entering class, however, could find themselves paying the full $19,000 rate. He declined to reveal the vote tally for the tuition decision, though he did admit that it was not unanimous.</p>\n<p>Students and faculty grew increasingly vocal during the course of the meeting, as Epstein cherry-picked from questions submitted in writing, refusing to answer - or even read aloud - those he characterized as \"offensive\" or \"inflammatory.\" He ended the meeting after less than an hour,</p>\n<p>Epstein says 25% of students will receive free tuition via financial aid. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CooperTaskForce/status/326735792502345728\">As many as half</a> could wind up paying full $19,000 rate.</p>\n<p>\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion/status/326737813284470785\">We may lose some students</a> but we have a cushion of other students to rely on.\"</p>\n<p><strong>12:50</strong> | The public meeting has ended, less than an hour after it began.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> | This post has been revised and updated over the course of the day as new information became available.</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 4, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 3, "name": "Epstein"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York City"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York Times"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mark Epstein"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Free Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union Task Force"}, {"count": 1, "name": "CU"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [21, 127, 169], "weight": 0.37744140625}, {"color": [230, 241, 245], "weight": 0.18505859375}], "keywords": [{"score": 46, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 33, "name": "students"}, {"score": 32, "name": "scholarships"}, {"score": 31, "name": "epstein"}, {"score": 26, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 22, "name": "union"}, {"score": 17, "name": "meeting"}, {"score": 15, "name": "rate"}, {"score": 11, "name": "college"}, {"score": 10, "name": "000"}], "published": 1366792260000, "provider_name": "Studentactivism", "type": "html"}
