An evening to deepen understanding of what is going and why... and to declare that WE MUST RESIST.</p>\n<p>We are at a potentially pivotal moment. People are raising their heads and looking to express their opposition. But the powers that be are now engaging in high-stakes damage control: to frighten people into submission and to tell people not to worry, just go along with \"the new normal.\" No, we will not be complicit, we do not consent, we take responsibility to act.</p>\n<p>On May 23, World Can't Wait published the  <a href=\"http://org.salsalabs.com/o/1170/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=13340\">Close Guantanamo NOW</a> message in <em>The New York Times</em> as a full page ad.  It says, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In the name of safety, fear, or revenge, American presidents cannot be allowed to arrogate to themselves the power of judge, jury and executioner. Actions that utilize de facto torture, that run roughshod over the rule of law and due process, and that rain down terror and murder on peoples and nations, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/pakistani-court-declares-us-drone-strikes-in-the-countrys-tribal-belt-illegal-8609843.html\">amount to war crimes</a>. Such actions cannot in any way be morally justified in the name of \"protecting Americans.\" The lives of people living here are not more precious than any other people's lives.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>History demands that we follow through on this stand.
