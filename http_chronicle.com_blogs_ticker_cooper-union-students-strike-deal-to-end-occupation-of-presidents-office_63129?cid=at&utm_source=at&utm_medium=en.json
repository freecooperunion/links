The college's leaders have said that it is <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/Cooper-Union-Bastion-of-Free/129749/\">facing severe financial problems.</a> Last year Cooper Union announced it would begin <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/cooper-union-will-start-collecting-tuition-from-graduate-students/42654\">collecting tuition from graduate students,</a> and in April it rolled out a plan to <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/cooper-union-will-begin-charging-tuition-to-undergraduate-students/59119\">charge undergraduates.</a> The moves prompted <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/argolinkroundups/reactions-to-the-tuition-protest-at-cooper-union\">vocal protests</a> on the campus, including the occupation of Mr. Bharucha's office. That occupation ended last Friday.</p>\n<p>In a news release, the administration and the group of occupiers said that their <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/files/2013/07/Agreement_Final.pdf\">agreement</a> included the creation of a working group that would pursue a \"good-faith effort to seek an alternative to tuition\" that would sustain the institution's financial health. The group will include board and faculty members, alumni, students, and representatives of the administration, according to the announcement. The agreement said that all individuals who had violated the college's policies during the occupation would be granted amnesty.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/cooper-union-students-strike-deal-to-end-occupation-of-presidents-office/63129\">Return to Top </a></p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 3, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York City"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Bharucha"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [11, 11, 11], "weight": 0.04736328125}, {"color": [218, 218, 218], "weight": 0.01513671875}], "keywords": [{"score": 22, "name": "occupation"}, {"score": 20, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 20, "name": "bharucha"}, {"score": 16, "name": "students"}, {"score": 16, "name": "occupiers"}, {"score": 15, "name": "undergraduates"}, {"score": 13, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 12, "name": "group"}, {"score": 11, "name": "agreement"}, {"score": 11, "name": "college"}], "published": 1373922270000, "provider_name": "Chronicle", "type": "html"}
