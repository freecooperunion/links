With half its scholarship torn out, so was torn out half my heart. I can't express how angry and frustrated, depressed, anxious, and perversely relieved I feel, because I am also so numb. Numb from exhausted work in benefit to the school. Numb from aggravating interactions. Numb from waiting and waiting and finally having the sledgehammer connect, only for it to feel anesthetized by the constant 2 years of friction.</p>\n<p>In this time of adversity, however, I also felt a strange and prickly new element. It's both elating and terrifying. It's embodied in the immediate responses by Alumni, along the lines of jumping in now to help the school more, versus jumping ship now and disconnecting forever. This fractured community scares me almost as much as the reality of tuition, and all the consequences, foreseen and unforeseen. I feel awash in waves, from my own feelings, as well as those of my fellow alumni, like we're lost at sea in a storm, and barely staying afloat.</p>\n<p>But this afternoon, head hung, leaving the area, I also remembered some of Peter Cooper's words. And the words of fellow students a century past. I felt like I saw a fire on the horizon, perhaps land in the distance.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fchroniclingamerica.loc.gov%2Flccn%2Fsn84024670%2F1871-06-13%2Fed-1%2Fseq-3%2F&amp;h=oAQGxgiAZ&amp;s=1\">June, 1871, the Daily State Journal posted</a> [1a] the students' address to the school, in the speech that we have often been quoting, regarding <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.lighthousesurvival.com%2Flibrary%2Fthe_history_of_the_first_locomotives_in_america-1871.pdf&amp;h=OAQFJ8vcj&amp;s=1\">Everlasting Protest</a>. [1b]</p>\n<blockquote>\"But among the substantial results will be the advancement and diffusion of that larger culture of hand, and head and heart, that moulds the skilled artisan and upright intelligent citizen, without whom our country need hope for no broad and thorough development of its boundless resources, nor elevation and permanency for its free institutions. The mission of the Cooper Union comprehends more than this... it is an <b>everlasting protest</b> against that avarice and ambition which rear overshadowing fortunes for mere personal gratification.\"</blockquote>\n<p>And it made me wonder. For over a year, we have been thinking that the time of trial, this lead-up to the decision of tuition, was precisely this time. That this was the everlasting protest. But I think we were wrong. We did the right thing, we've done all we can do over this period. But I think we were mistaken about these predictions and visions.<br></p>\n<p>I believe that we have mistaken <b><u>protest for everlasting</u> free education</b> with <b><u>everlasting protest</u> for free education</b>.</p>\n<p>Our cause was right, but our clause was wrong.</p>\n<p>Often misattributed to Thomas Jefferson is a quote by <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikiquote.org%2Fwiki%2FLeonard_H._Courtney&amp;h=FAQFechu9&amp;s=1\">Leonard Courtney [2]</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.</blockquote>\n<p>(Who also, ironically, coined \"Lies - damned lies - and statistics\".) What we have here is the beginning salvo in the <b>continuous and unending</b> battle for freedom - in our case, freedom of education at The Cooper Union. We can't protest once, for a perpetually free Cooper. We have to protest <b>forever</b> for a free Cooper, every day, every year. </p>\n<b><i>That is the price of our free education.</i></b> <p>The students bravely led the way with making this known, to the community, and to ourselves. But it was a single step in a journey of a thousand miles. A journey we all need to continue, in whatever way we can; a journey we owe to them, and to ourselves, and to Peter Cooper.</p>\n<p>That leads me to a second quote, the words posted on the  <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcooperuniontaskforce.com%2Fwiki%2Ftiki-download_file.php%3FfileId%3D47&amp;h=yAQEMKBko&amp;s=1\">1984 Alumni directory jacket</a>, eerily clairvoyant words of Peter Cooper himself [3]:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In the course of a century there will, of course be a great number of graduates of the Cooper Union and the day will surely come when they, these graduates, will rally round this institution, and if the plans I have formed can be executed in no other way they will see they are carried out\"</blockquote>\n<p>That time, last year, the announcement that tuition might be possible in the future, was <b>not</b> the most dangerous time for Cooper. It is <b>today.</b> Today, we will be tempted to throw in the towel, turn our backs on our school, and scream in frustration \"I tried!\" Well, try we did. But try we still must. We face an uphill battle for the soul of the school. We no longer need to avoid a confrontation with a distant force, now we need to march, uphill, already tired and demoralized from the loss of a major battle. Starting today, we must plan for the future of the school, mitigate the worst effects, tourniquet the wounds, and work together on how to retake its free nature, no matter how difficult it will be, no matter how long it will take. </p>\n<p>We don't get to pick how hard this path will be, we just need to walk it.</p>\n<b>Remember back when you started at Cooper? On that day, you needed Peter Cooper.</b> <b>Today, more than ever before, Peter Cooper needs you.</b> <p>Sean Cusack, BSE'98</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/sean-cusack/everlasting-protest/601447156534430\">[1a] </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/sean-cusack/everlasting-protest/601447156534430\">[1b] </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/sean-cusack/everlasting-protest/601447156534430\">[2] </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/sean-cusack/everlasting-protest/601447156534430\">[3] </a><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcooperuniontaskforce.com%2Fwiki%2Ftiki-download_file.php%3FfileId%3D47&amp;h=TAQF437Ec&amp;s=1\">http://cooperuniontaskforce.com/wiki/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=47</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikiquote.org%2Fwiki%2FLeonard_H._Courtney&amp;h=LAQGSrYQY&amp;s=1\">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonard_H._Courtney</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.lighthousesurvival.com%2Flibrary%2Fthe_history_of_the_first_locomotives_in_america-1871.pdf&amp;h=ZAQFstznA&amp;s=1\">http://blog.lighthousesurvival.com/library/the_history_of_the_first_locomotives_in_america-1871.pdf</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fchroniclingamerica.loc.gov%2Flccn%2Fsn84024670%2F1871-06-13%2Fed-1%2Fseq-3%2F&amp;h=tAQEnBHZF&amp;s=1\">http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024670/1871-06-13/ed-1/seq-3/</a> <p><br><img src=\"https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/59925_10151341405156767_1202151531_n.jpg\"><img src=\"https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s720x720/923162_10151341405461767_1112229631_n.jpg\"></p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 5, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 4, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 4, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Sean Cusack"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Daily State Journal"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Thomas Jefferson"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Leonard Courtney"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [54, 97, 163], "weight": 0.040283203125}, {"color": [0, 0, 0], "weight": 0.012939453125}, {"color": [243, 245, 249], "weight": 0.00927734375}], "keywords": [{"score": 57, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 50, "name": "everlasting"}, {"score": 31, "name": "numb"}, {"score": 28, "name": "protest"}, {"score": 23, "name": "alumni"}, {"score": 23, "name": "free"}, {"score": 22, "name": "peter"}, {"score": 20, "name": "school"}, {"score": 20, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 18, "name": "wiki"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Facebook", "type": "html"}
