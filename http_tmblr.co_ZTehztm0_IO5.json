A time honored tradition, the first recorded exhibition took place in 1860 at the historic Foundation Building. Works on view represent the culmination of each student's unique experience in the institution's top ranked programs. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>\n<p><strong>Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture</strong><br>Foundation Building, 7 East 7th St., b/w 3rd and 4th Aves.<br>An exhibition of student works that explores the role of architecture in contemporary culture and society through conceptual and scaled drawings, detailed three dimensional models and digital renderings. The Cooper Union End of Year Show has become a significant New York City tradition that has consistently showcased innovative and visionary projects by emerging architects, helping to launch. This year's projects include library designs for three sites in New York City, an architectural installation for OMI International Arts Center's Fields Sculpture Park; projects for new architectures on and near the Bowery as part of the New Museum Ideas City festival; and thesis projects that include the re-envisioning of the infrastructure of the devastated Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta; and the restoration of the prairie to create a continuous urban forest in Houston, Texas.</p>\n<p><strong>The School of Art</strong><br>Foundation Building, 7 East 7th St., b/w 3rd and 4th Aves. &amp; 41 Cooper Square, 3rd Ave., b/w 6th and 7th Sts.<br>With a commitment to radical and experimental artistic exploration, the School of Art has long been an incubator of significant artistic talents. Alumni range from Alex Katz, Eva Hesse and Lee Krasner to recent graduates Art Club 2000, the Bruce High Quality Foundation, Sara VanDerBeek and Trisha Baga. A diversity of sculpture, painting, graphic design, photography, film and video from the current student body will be on view in gallery spaces in the Foundation Building and 41 Cooper Square.</p>\n<p><strong>Albert Nerken School of Engineering</strong><br>41 Cooper Square, 3rd Ave., b/w 6th and 7th Sts.<br>Representing the different engineering disciplines, a dynamic array of projects will be on view for live demonstrations including a formula race car, several student made bridges, a series of mechanical arcade games, a balancing robot, and several unique musical instrument designs, among other things. The installation at 41 Cooper Square, Cooper Union's LEED Platinum building (ugh), showcases the inventive and invaluable outcomes generated by the fields of mechanical, electrical, civil, and chemical engineering.</p>\n<strong>Opening night: Tuesday, May 28 from 5-9 p.m.</strong><strong>Tuesday through Saturday, 12 to 7 p m.</strong><strong>Closed Sundays and Mondays</strong><br><strong> from May 28 - June 15, 2013</strong></blockquote>\n<p>**********</p>\n<p>Additionally, in - what, four? five? days?? the students have organized, produced works for, and curated an additional show entirely on their own, spanning the same floor that contains the presidential office that they have occupied for nearly three weeks, and the lobby that they have painted black.
