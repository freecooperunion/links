Pragmatism prevailed. In one case this meant keeping strategic silence. The Metropolitan Museum stayed mum about specific plans for the Whitney's Breuer Building, which it will occupy in 2015, the day after tomorrow in scheduling terms, while it hired yet another curator of modern and contemporary art.</p>\n<p>Everywhere marquee shows tended to be undisguised cash cows: plug in superstar names, do little of interest with them, watch the crowds herd through. Thus we were spoon-fed Warhol at the Met and Picasso at the Guggenheim. What did we learn? That Warhol influenced a lot of artists, and that Picasso painted in black and white. Who knew?</p>\n<p>At the Modern we got a celebrity-object show. Munch's 1895 pastel version of \"The Scream,\" notable for the $119.5 million it fetched at Sotheby's last May, is on a six-month loan to the museum from its new owner, the financier and MoMA trustee Leon Black. Otherwise undistinguished, it sits alone, sucking up attention, at the center of the museum's permanent galleries, accompanied by guards for crowd control.</p>\n<p>And nice though it was to see veterans like Richard Artschwager and Yayoi Kusama, now in their 80s, taking solo spins at the Whitney Museum, you had to wonder why they'd been chosen over other deserving but less consistently rewarded contemporaries. That both have, in late career, come to be represented by Gagosian Gallery may be worth pondering.</p>\n<p>Also worth a thought is whether mild events like the smartly installed Wade Guyton solo at the Whitney would have received the extensive notice it did if more challenging fare had been around this year. The 2012 Whitney Biennial at least did its job in locating a couple of recent trends: M.F.A. Outsider Art and Neo-Victoriana. Historians of the future should have fun with both. Walking through, I had flashes of the spookily ingenious Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles. And that's a compliment, pretty much.</p>\n<p>In general during the year, though, you had to look off-center, either to smaller shows or smaller museums for stimulation, to find what you didn't already know, including revisionist views of two masters. \"Bernini: Sculpting in Clay,\" at the Met, offered one. Marble sculptures by the prodigious Baroque artist are rarely seen outside Italy. (The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles brought some together in 2008.) The terra cotta models are in some ways even better than the final sculptures: the first, untrammeled thoughts of a supremely expressive hand and eye.</p>\n<p>\"Joseph Albers in America: Painting on Paper\" at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum, while less spectacular, was even more surprising. Based on his precision-made series of geometric paintings \"Homage to the Square,\" Albers is often taken for a militantly uptight formalist. The sketches and color studies, peppered with written notes to self, in the Morgan show revealed a different artist entirely, the equivalent of a tantric adept, seeking aesthetic and spiritual expansion through discipline.</p>\n<p>MoMA also went for the not-obvious in \"Tokyo 1955-1970: A New Avant-Garde.\" The show radically increases our knowledge of 20th century Japanese modernism, hitherto known, to the extent it is known at all, for the movement called Gutai. Gutai was there at MoMA, but so was much, much more, including a cache of immediately postwar Surrealist paintings familiar to practically no one, in or out of Japan.</p>\n<p>No New York exhibition did a more impressive job of writing new history than the panoramic \"Caribbean: Crossroads of the World,\" which appeared simultaneously at El Museo del Barrio, the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Queens Museum of Art. The story told dates back centuries and comes into the present, and is an integral part of the fabric of New York City itself, an immigrant destination.</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 3, "name": "MoMA"}, {"count": 2, "name": "New York"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Picasso"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Gutai"}, {"count": 1, "name": "J.
