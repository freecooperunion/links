See most recent updates at the bottom.</em>\n<p>A little before 11 a.m., more than 50 students took over Cooper Union President Jamshed Bharucha's office on the seventh floor of the school. Students say they're holding <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FreeCooperUnion\">a vote of no confidence</a> in Bharucha's leadership--and trying to gather as many signatures to the petition as possible. </p>\n<p>The action comes two weeks after the school's board of trustees announced that future students, including the incoming class of 2014, <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/04/cooper_union_en.php\">would be paying tuition</a> for an education that has been historically free. This isn't the students' first protest: In December of last year, 11 art students occupied the Peter Cooper suite on the eighth floor for a week in protest of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/10/cooper-union-occupation-ends_n_2271737.html\">the proposed tuition hike</a>, fully barricading themselves in.</p>\n<p>Security wouldn't let press upstairs, but students did send down two representatives to meet me in the lobby--Angus Buchanan, a second-year, and Aaron Graham, a senior.</p>\n<p>\"All the people upstairs and doing these sorts of actions to keep this school free--we're not fighting for ourselves. We're fighting for future students because we're all already guaranteed the scholarship we've been given,\" Graham said.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LuunFJZSnYs\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Even with the black banners draped from windows on the building's fa&#231;ade, bystanders could easily mistake the protest for a school-supported art installation. No police were present, and students were milling freely in and out of the building while the administration held talks with those conducting the sit-in upstairs.</p>\n<p>\"This a peaceful and nonviolent action. Meetings are being held with students to discuss it further,\" said Claire McCarthy, director of public affairs. </p>\n<p>\"It's a little chaotic, we're waiting,\" said organizer and senior art student Victoria Sobel. \"We know they're going to come back and give us some sort of ultimatum.\"</p>\n<p>At least there's pizza. After students wrapped up an interview with <em>Democracy Now!</em>, alumni organization <a href=\"http://friendsofcooperunion.org/\">Friends of Cooper Union</a> sent the students several stacks of hot melty cheese. </p>\n<p>City College of New York students will join Cooper Union students to rally <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/666580176701209/666637376695489/\">today at 6 p.m. in Cooper Square</a>.
