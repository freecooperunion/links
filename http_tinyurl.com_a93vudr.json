They bravely called upon the administration of the Cooper Union to honor their contracts with early decision applicants. Many others could not physically be there, but current and former Art School students read letters on behalf of them. One early decision applicant wrote, directly addressing President Jamshed Bharucha, that \"you may choose to defer us. But we will not defer to you.\" Another early decision applicant referred to President Bharucha as running the school like a business, rather than as a university. The applicant then remarked, \"but by failing to honor your contracts with early decision applicants, that's just bad business.\"</p>\n<a href=\"http://freeuniversitynyc.org/files/2013/02/IMG_3784.jpg\"><img src=\"http://freeuniversitynyc.org/files/2013/02/IMG_3784-300x225.jpg\"></a> <a href=\"http://freeuniversitynyc.org/files/2013/02/IMG_3787.jpg\"><img src=\"http://freeuniversitynyc.org/files/2013/02/IMG_3787-225x300.jpg\"></a> <p>For more information about the struggle at Cooper Union, see the website of <a href=\"http://cusos.org/\">CUSOS (Cooper Union Student Action to Save our School)</a>.
