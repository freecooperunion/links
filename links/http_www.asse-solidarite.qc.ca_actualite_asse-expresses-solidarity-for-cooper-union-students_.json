rouge (red square) to their shirts and most recently displayed the symbol en masse at graduation ceremonies in New York City.</p>\n<p>As was seen in Quebec, students at Cooper Union have undertaken direct action, in their sit-in at the president's office, underlining the importance of utilizing creative tactics to draw attention to the urgency of our common struggle. Students at Cooper are also challenging the inaccessible and authoritarian models of governance imposed by both government and university powers.</p>\n<p>For us in Quebec, the student struggle at Cooper Union that has taken place over the last year, for the same ideals of free education and social justice that drove our historic strike in 2012, is an inspiring example of the international nature of our collective struggle.</p>\n<p>ASS&#201; expresses its full support and solidarity for the students at Cooper Union in their just fight for free and universally accessible education and we express our full support for your ongoing occupation of the seventh floor that continues to light up red in the Manhattan sky on each summer evening.</p>\n<p>In struggle and solidarity,</p>\n<p>Association pour une solidarit&#233; syndicale &#233;tudiante (ASS&#201;)<br> Montreal, Quebec, June 3, 2013</p>\n<em>Many thanks to Stefan Christoff, &#201;milie Joly and Ludvic-Moquin Beaudry.
