By announcing that the school to which they applied does not intend to honor their commitment to the early admissions process, and that it in fact has no \"sustainable model\" for operating in the future, Cooper Union will surely drive many of those applicants - the very students who were most committed to enrolling at CU - to other colleges.</p>\n<p>As I wrote last fall, <a href=\"http://studentactivism.net/2012/12/12/how-tuition-hurts-colleges/\">Cooper Union's reputation rests more than usually on the quality of its students</a>.
