This new wave of leaks comes after the Village Voice released confidential transcripts from a board meeting last year, in which the board explicitly contradicted its public stance that the school was not considering closing individual schools within the university. The documents describe a less-than-student-sympathetic process leading up to, and in the wake of, the much-publicized decision last year to implement tuition at the historically \"free as air and water\" institution.</p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2013/05/09/photos-nyu-joins-cooper-union-in-solidarity-rally/\">we last</a> <a href=\"http://nyulocal.com/city/2013/05/02/students-converge-at-cooper-union-for-may-day/\">checked in</a> with the unfolding debacle over at Cooper Union, a lot has happened. Although a final decision was reached by University President Jamshed Bharucha and the Board of Trustees to implement tuition beginning with this year's applicants to the class of 2018, the students are still fighting the administration. Their first major action last fall commanded most of the media attention the group has received, where eleven students barricaded themselves inside the clock tower on the top floor of their Foundations Building on Astor Place.</p>\n<p>Since then, Free Cooper Union has wrapped the Board of Trustees in \"transparent\" Saran Wrap, put a crying student on the table during a board meeting, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/88178/free-cooper-remixes-banksy-confessional/\">added a confessing President Bharucha to a Banksy priest</a>, and most notably, took over the president's office for two full months this summer, where they continued to produce alternative solutions (and taught their own courses). The end to that occupation in July was negotiated based on a few <a href=\"http://cooper.edu/about/news/occupation-presidents-office-ends\">basic terms</a>: amnesty for the students involved, student representation on the board, establishment of a working group to revert CU to a full-tuition model, and the creation of a Community Commons room to keep activities held in the President's office available. The goal of these conditions was to make the board and the university administration more accountable to the school community, addressing FCU's chief cause of complaint, but since those negotiations not much has changed.</p>\n<p>The inciting incident for the current round of document leaks was a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ItUY1iWUf2NnhGUbSqzyJrk_bmKsbOdU_BF42CO0nv0/edit\">decision by the Board</a> to suspend elections for a non-voting student representative that were, according to the July negotiations, slated to move forward this month to stick to an agreed-upon December start date as the first monthly meeting with student representation. The Board has decided to push that start date back to March 2014, which would make all of the current candidates ineligible for elections under the clause that a student representative must be able to sit for the full two year term. The Board alleged that the students did not comply with the election procedure that was <a href=\"http://cooper.edu/about/trustees/reports/september-2013-board-report\">negotiated by the board in September</a>, whereby the board would elect a representative from the three candidates with the most votes. The students presented the Board with only the winner of the vote, on the grounds that the board's rules violated a reasonably democratic definition of \"election.\"</p>\n<p>December is going to be a busy month at Cooper. The Working Group will present their proposal for a sustainable tuition alternative to the Board on December 1. Later that month sitting Chairman Epstein's term will expire, and according to Free Cooper Union's <a href=\"http://cusos.org/post/66786423755/for-immediate-release-cooper-board-suspends\">statement</a>, \"students will be present at the December board meeting, one way or another.\" All of the documents are available in full on FCU's <a href=\"http://cusos.org/\">website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FreeCooperUnion\">Facebook page</a> daily. NYULocal will continue to post about the leaks as they come into focus.
