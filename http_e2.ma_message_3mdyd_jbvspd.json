But time is running out: the Cooper Union Alumni Association (CUAA) elections for Alumni Trustee and Alumni Council members are fast coming to a close this Wednesday, 5/1.  We must act now to demand effective Board and CUAA leadership.  </p>\n<p>Go to  <a href=\"http://e2.ma/click/3mdyd/jbvspd/jb3u8\">cualumni.com</a> and vote Kevin Slavin (A'95) via write-in for Alumni Trustee.  Kevin is an active alumni, MIT professor, successful entrepreneur, supporter of the founding mission and vision of Cooper Union, and will bring true transparency and problem-solving to the crisis at Cooper Union.  Please find additional recommendations for CUAA elections at the end of this email.</p>\n<p>Below is a message from Kevin:</p>\n<br><b>Here we are at the end of an error, and we still have no idea exactly what happened. </b> <br><p>We are still looking at a WSJ article from 2009 about how Cooper  <a href=\"http://e2.ma/click/3mdyd/jbvspd/z33u8\">sidestepped a financial crisis</a>, at the same time we are reading statements claiming it's been deficit spending for years.   We are wondering why the Board of Trustees keeps <a href=\"http://e2.ma/click/3mdyd/jbvspd/fw4u8\">accusing the alumni of not giving enough</a>, when our donations formed 38% of funds in the decennial report while no one is clear, still, where any of that money went.  We are still waiting for the Board to acknowledge that there are no long-term financial physics to Cooper Union that they are not, in some way, responsible for. </p>\n<p>Among the things we've lacked thus far are eyes and ears at the table. That's what a representative is for. What I'd say, there at the table, is that I'd like future actions to be informed by what everyone else thinks. That hasn't mattered in quite a while. But in principle, that's what trustees are for. I don't know if its possible to have a free Cooper Union. I do know that it's been very difficult to have a meaningful conversation about it, and that we've been expected to trust that everything is in good hands. As an alum, as a former adjunct instructor, as an assistant professor at MIT, as a serial entrepreneur and an investor, I do not. </p>\n<p>I'd rather do just about anything than spend more time with a group of men that have given us But after last week, I'd rather do this than do nothing. If this happens, it will be about restoring trust and communication and transparency (here's a video of a  restored, lets start by restoring honest communication about what's happened and what can happen now.  <a href=\"http://e2.ma/click/3mdyd/jbvspd/vo5u8\">few reasons to trust their instincts or their actions</a>.  <br><br><a href=\"http://e2.ma/click/3mdyd/jbvspd/bh6u8\">talk</a>  I gave some time ago on the subject).
