The Board of Trustees is set to vote on tuition implementation this spring. As that vote approaches, the impact of this month's lock-in remains vague.</p>\n<p>On December 3 <sup>rd</sup>, eleven Cooper Union students and one student journalist from The New School barricaded themselves in a room behind the large clock on the eighth floor of CU's Foundation Building. They drafted a communiqu&#233; detailing their <a href=\"http://www.cusos.org/students-for-a-free-cooper-union-lock-in-to-cooper-unions-foundation-building-to-preserve-free-education-2/\">demands</a> - that the administration must \"stop pursuing new tuition-based education programs,\" that the Board of Trustees take measures to increase transparency (including making meeting minutes available, electing a voting student and faculty member from each school, and agreeing to \"implement a process by which board members may be removed through a vote)\", and most significant, that the sitting Cooper Union President Jamshed Bharucha step down.</p>\n<p>The students remained in the Peter Cooper Suite for a week before walking out of the building and holding a press conference on December 10 <sup>th</sup>. During that week, actions and summits were held at the school in conjunction with various organizations including Occupy Wall Street, Strike Debt, and the Free University.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, however, it's unclear how Cooper Union will respond to the students' actions. In the early days of the lock-in, President Bhracha angered student protestors when he released a <a href=\"http://cooper.edu/about/news/president-bharuchas-memo-student-blockade\">memo</a> dismissing the \"11 art students\" blockading themselves in the Cooper Union Suite. The administration's priority, Bharucha said, \"is the safety of our students and to insure that the actions of a few do not disrupt classes for all.\" Jolene Travis, a CU spokeswoman, released a <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/cooper-union-students-end-occupation-of-suite-after-a-week/\">statement</a> to the New York Times saying only \"We are pleased that the 11 Cooper Union art students have ended their lock-in and left the eighth-floor Peter Cooper Suite space peacefully and without further incident. We are continuing the responsible process needed to assure the future of the Cooper Union for generations to come.\" Though vague, Travis's language in no way suggests that the CU administration will end their investigation into tuition implementation. NYU Local has reached out to the school for comment, but has received no response.</p>\n<p>Since the school announced on October 31, 2011, that they would begin to consider charging tuition, several alumni initiatives have come together to offer alternative plans. In response to Chairman of the Board of Trustees Mike Epstein's comment last November that the school's financial troubles were due in part to low donation rates among the alumni, an organization called <a href=\"http://freecooperunion.com/\">Money On The Table</a> was formed by alum and associate professor of art Mike Essl '96, which has raised $450,483 as of this morning from 583 pledges. On MOTT's pledge form, it's made clear that the money pledged will go to CU's development office \"on the unequivocal condition that Cooper Union's undergraduate programs remain TUITION FREE.\"</p>\n<p>In addition to the efforts made by Money On The Table, a community-initiated <a href=\"http://www.cooperuniontaskforce.com/\">Task Force</a> has formed to dissect CU's spending after President Bhracha promised and failed to initiate a task force within the school's administration. An organization called <a href=\"http://friendsofcooperunion.org/\">Friends of Cooper Union</a> has released widely-approved proposal called The Way Forward to preserve CU without charging tuition, which has garnered over 1,000 signatures of support from the CU community. In addition, a <a href=\"http://signon.org/sign/save-cooper-union-without\">petition</a> written by Henry Chapman (School of Architecture '11), who spoke at a summit in CU's Great Hall on the first night of the lock-in, to promote the Friends of Cooper Union's plan as well as to affirm Cooper's commitment to free education, has received 3,452 signatures on SignOn.org as of this morning.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.cusos.org/students-for-a-free-cooper-union-wish-you-a-transparent-and-accountable-holiday/\">blog post</a> on December 10 <sup>th</sup>, the last day of their lock-in, the Students for a Free Cooper Union insisted that \"Jamshed Bharucha's absence and lack of direct communication over the past week has made it clear that he is a liability to this institution. We can declare without hesitation that Jamshed Bharucha is no longer our president.\" A protest that students staged at a board meeting during that week, where they wept on the tables and surrounded the building with Saran Wrap to represent their fight for increased transparency, was only the beginning. The students made \"a promise to the administration, the board of trustees, and general public: there will be student and faculty participation at the next board meeting, and the next board meeting, and the next.\"</p>\n<p>Within Cooper Union, the demands of the Students for a Free Coopr Union may only have been symbollically met, with very little response from the administration. Outside of Cooper, however, their lock-in has served to raise the public prioritization of student debt. Since the beginning of the protest, when the students in the Peter Cooper Suite dropped a large red banner reading \"Free Education To All,\" the fight against tuition - which would not effect any current class of students at the Cooper Union - has been a universal one. Student lock-in member Kristi Cavataro made a statement citing the state of higher education today, where across Astor Place, NYU's tuition sits at $43,384. \"We live in a world where massive student debt and the rising cost of higher education remain unchecked, where students are treated as customers and faculty as contractors,\" said Cavataro. \"Cooper Union's mission of free education affords quality and excellence and offers an alternative for a better future of higher education.\" If Cooper Union's 110-year-old commitment to free education can end in the current climate, what will the relationship between students and schools look like in the future, when already there is so much pressure on both sides for students to get their money's worth and for faculty to teach something students consider valuable?</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 11, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 8, "name": "CU"}, {"count": 3, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 3, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Board of Trustees"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Bhracha"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Friends of Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Henry Chapman"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mike Essl"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Saran"}, {"count": 1, "name": "NYU"}, {"count": 1, "name": "MOTT"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York Times"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Free University"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cavataro"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Free Coopr Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Kristi Cavataro"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Board of Trustees Mike Epstein"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jolene Travis"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Task Force"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union Suite"}, {"count": 1, "name": "School of Architecture"}, {"count": 1, "name": "NYU Local"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Travis"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Free Cooper Union"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [16, 17, 19], "weight": 0.028564453125}, {"color": [74, 75, 76], "weight": 0.01611328125}, {"color": [234, 238, 239], "weight": 0.010986328125}, {"color": [142, 145, 146], "weight": 0.0068359375}], "keywords": [{"score": 100, "name": "students"}, {"score": 89, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 70, "name": "lock-in"}, {"score": 61, "name": "union"}, {"score": 53, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 40, "name": "bharucha"}, {"score": 33, "name": "schools"}, {"score": 32, "name": "education"}, {"score": 30, "name": "free"}, {"score": 30, "name": "board"}], "published": 1355961600000, "provider_name": "Nyulocal", "type": "html"}
