The faculty members eventually discovered that they weren't truly being charged with thinking up creative solutions, but rather with serving as a rubber stamp for administrative plans to introduce new tuition-based programs.</p>\n<p>\"This could have been an opportunity for imagining an academic collective vision of the institution to solve the pressing financial crisis rather than a set of prescribed assignments,\" the letter reads.</p>\n<p>Aside from the fact that the faculty members are committed to preserving the maxim of free education, they also aren't convinced that implementing certain tuition programs will help cut into the school's shortfall. A popular proposal from the administration is to implement tuition-based graduate and certificate programs throughout the college's three schools of study.
