At the same time, the cross that adorned his neck was replaced with a giant Flavor Flav style clock with a red face and hands set <a href=\"https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/2940698510/73b563bf6ca3309bc65aadd08e2b21d5.png\">just prior to midnight</a>, the symbol of the <a href=\"http://cusos.org\">Free Cooper Union</a> activist movement.</p>\n<p>For more than a century Cooper Union, whose campus is just a stone's throw away from the repurposed painting, has been free to all students accepted for admission. In the wake of a series of disastrous financial developments, however, the college's administration has announced that they will begin charging admission next fall. The Free Cooper Union movement sprung up in the wake of the tuition announcement to fight to reverse that decision, and to bring other reforms to the university.</p>\n<p>Banksy, the notorious and reclusive British graffiti artist, is currently in the middle of <a href=\"http://www.banksyny.com\">a monthlong \"residency\"</a> in New York city. The new painting, entitled Concrete Confessional, depicts a weary priest.</p>\n<p>Free Cooper Union has adopted Peter Cooper as a symbol of their struggle, deploying his likeness and statements in support of free higher education prominently in their campaign.</p>\n<em>Image from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/streetartnews/status/389391076131627008/photo/1\">@StreetArtNews</a> on Twitter.</em> <p><strong>Update</strong> | Now wait just one goddamn minute.</p>\n<p>New photos posted to Twitter appear to show <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GraffitiDoll/status/389421244451266560/photo/1\">a second painting</a> next to Bansky's original, in which someone who looks extraordinarily like Cooper Union President Jamshed Bharucha is making confession.

It's real. It's all real.</p>\n<p>A photo <a href=\"http://www.banksyny.com\">from Banksy's website</a> shows that the original version of the piece didn't include the painting of the Bharucha lookalike. And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whiteley/status/389428554473410560/photo/1\">the photo at right</a>, taken from a different angle than the previous ones, confirms that the Bharucha add-on isn't just a photoshop job. (That photo also makes clear, as none of the others I've seen do, that the confessor the priest/Cooper figure are painted on the back wall of room-like enclosures, not on a slab inside a concrete frame.)</p>\n<p>Someone, sometime last night, conceived and executed a revision of Banksy's original piece that changed the priest into Peter Cooper and added a penitent Bharucha in exactly the place a confessor would be.</p>\n<p>Wow.</p>\n<p><strong>Third Update</strong> | Commenter Bob Cooley believes that the Bharucha in prayer was painted over an image of an altarboy that Banksy put up last night, perhaps intended as today's entry in the monthlong series. Images of the altarboy can be found <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151890336129454&amp;set=a.10150971548734454.442309.518334453&amp;type=1&amp;theater\">here</a> and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>For whatever it may be worth, there's no reference to the altarboy at the <a href=\"http://www.banksyny.com\">banksyny.com</a> site, at least not yet. I have no information about whether that painting was by Banksy or was someone else's addition. If I find out more, I'll update again.</p>\n<p>Oh, and one thing I missed earlier.
