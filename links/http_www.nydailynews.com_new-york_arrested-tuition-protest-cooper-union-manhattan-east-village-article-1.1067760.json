after he scaled his alma mater's namesake statue in protest over the announcement that the famed institution will start charging tuition for graduate studies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Jesse+Kreuzer\">Jesse Kreuzer</a>, 23, of Baldwin, LI, stood perched atop the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Peter+Cooper\">Peter Cooper</a> monument outside the school's iconic Foundation Building at Cooper Square for nearly an hour and 40 minutes before he was brought down by police in a cherry picker.</p>\n<p>A crowd of about 100 students beat on drums and held signs and banners cheering Kreuzer on, yelling, \"Free Jesse Kreuzer!\" and \"End student debt!\"</p>\n<p>Kreuzer held a sign during his brief moment in the spotlight that read, \"Free tuition it's our mission.\"</p>\n<p>On his way down, Kreuzer - who was led away in cuffs - patted an officer on the back and chatted him up.</p>\n<p>\"He's a talented artist and we love him,\" fourth-year architectural student <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Olivia+Ahn\">Olivia Ahn</a>, 21, said about Kreuzer.</p>\n<p>Kreuzer was hit with charges of reckless endangerment, criminal trespass and obstructing governmental administration, police said.</p>\n<p>The demonstration was a show of retaliation against The Cooper Union President Jamshed Bharucha's plan to charge tuition for master's programs starting in 2013. The school has been well-known for providing full scholarships to all its students for a century.</p>\n<p>\"Cooper Union provides a level of egalitarianism, unparalleled,\" Ahn said. \"We trek here for our free education. We don't have fancy facilities like NYU and Columbia, we come here because it's free.\"</p>\n<p>Cops also arrested <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Sara+Abruna\">Sara Abruna</a>, 23, of Brooklyn, who tried to duck under a taped-off area. She was charged with harassment, disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration.</p>\n<p>sarmaghan@nydailynews.com</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 3, "name": "Kreuzer"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Jesse Kreuzer"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "The Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Columbia"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Olivia Ahn"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Ahn"}, {"count": 1, "name": "NYU"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Brooklyn"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Sam Costanza"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Sara Abruna"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Baldwin"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York Daily News Jesse Kreuzer"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [221, 71, 68], "weight": 0.026123046875}, {"color": [248, 242, 244], "weight": 0.020263671875}, {"color": [232, 143, 144], "weight": 0.01611328125}], "keywords": [{"score": 80, "name": "kreuzer"}, {"score": 31, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 26, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 18, "name": "jesse"}, {"score": 16, "name": "students"}, {"score": 15, "name": "ahn"}, {"score": 13, "name": "free"}, {"score": 13, "name": "governmental"}, {"score": 13, "name": "monument"}, {"score": 13, "name": "charged"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Nydailynews", "type": "html"}
