constitute the events surrounding <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union\">Cooper Union</a>'s announcement that they would begin charging tuition. The possible mismanagement of the school's finances and the subsequent reactions of students, faculty, alumni and organized protest groups have attracted widespread media attention, and activist groups have staged a series of occupations, protests, and projects demanding that the school president, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamshed_Bharucha\">Jamshed Bharucha</a> resign, promoting a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence\">vote of no confidence</a>, and insisting that the administration address the concerns of students and the public.</p>\n<p>It has been reported that the Cooper Union financial crisis was due to a combination of problems caused by poor fiscal decisions, lack of accountability, the economic recession of the late 2000s, the selling off the institution's assets, and the recent building of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/41_Cooper_Square\">41 Cooper Square</a>, which cost the school $175 million. In 2009, after the recession, Cooper Union's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management\">managed assets</a> (including investments in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund\">hedge funds</a>) lost 14%.</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul><li>\n<b>September:</b> The inauguration of president Jamshed Bharucha took place, and the literature provided during the main ceremony lacked any mention of \"free\" or \"full-scholarship\" in its full history and descriptions of the school.<sup>[<i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed </a></i>]</sup> The various speeches also omitted these words focusing on other words such as \"global\" and \"growth.\"<sup>[<i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed </a></i>]</sup></li>\n\t<li>\n<b>October:</b> The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union\">Cooper Union</a> administration deletes mentions of the full-scholarship or history of free education from the school's website. \"Free as air\" is also deleted from the Cooper Union article on Wikipedia. There was a brief back and forth as they put it back up when people noticed. The school's motto for over a century, \"education ought to be as free as air and water\" was dropped completely with no announcement.<sup>[<i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\">citation needed </a></i>]</sup></li>\n\t<li>\n<b>October:</b> The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union\">Cooper Union</a> administration announced to the public, to the <i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times\">New York Times</a></i>, and at a student forum that its available funds were vastly depleted.

The administration maintained that they would continue to offer need-based tuition remission to incoming undergraduates on a \"sliding scale\". Cooper Union announced that its Board of Trustees were to attempt to establish a new tuition-based cross-disciplinary graduate program, expand its fee-based continuing education programs, and charge tuition to some students in its existing graduate programs, effective September 2013.</li>\n\t<li>\n<b>May 8:</b> A group of students and members of the public occupy Bharucha's office.</li>\n\t<li>\n<b>August:</b> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union\">Cooper Union</a> Vice President of Finance, T.

Overnight, the piece is \"transformed by an anonymous, unauthorized collaborator into a visual statement of opposition to the administration\" of Cooper Union, by the addition of a Peter Cooper-style beard to the priest, and a portrait of a penitent Jamshed Bharucha, the Cooper Union President, in the structure adjacent to the Banksy piece. \"Free Cooper: The Musical\" was added to a third structure, a homage to another work in Banksy's October series.</li>\n</ul><p>Free Cooper Union is the name of an organized effort to protest the 2011 proposed changes in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union\">Cooper Union</a> tuition policy.
