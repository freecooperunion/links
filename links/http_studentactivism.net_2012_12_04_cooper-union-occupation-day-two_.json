(Cooper Union, founded as an institution committed to radical accessibility in 1859, is today one of only a handful of American colleges to provide full tuition scholarships to all admitted undergraduate students.)</p>\n<p>The Cooper Union occupiers released <a href=\"http://www.pdf-archive.com/2012/12/04/12-4-culockin-press-release/\">a second statement</a> this morning. In it, they reiterated their intention to remain in occupation \"until our demands are met or we are otherwise removed.\" The group also announced plans for a press conference outside the Foundation Building at 2:30 this afternoon. Additionally,  <a href=\"http://www.livestream.com/occupynyc\">a livestream of the occupation</a> has been set up, and is broadcasting as of the time of this writing.</p>\n<p>The New School Free Press has been covering the occupation since it began. <a href=\"http://www.newschoolfreepress.com/2012/12/03/live-cooper-union-day-of-action/\">Their liveblog</a> now reports that a group of students who occupied a space on the fourth floor of the Foundation Building overnight in solidarity with the eighth floor demonstrators were removed by campus security this morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Noon Update</strong> | I mentioned this on Twitter yesterday, but it's worth repeating here. All current Cooper Union undergraduates, and all new admits for Fall 2013, are guaranteed free tuition until graduation. The college has pledged not to charge any student currently enrolled or applying any tuition fees whatsoever.</p>\n<p>That means that all the folks who are accusing the CU occupiers of acting in their own narrow self-interest are wrong. From a financial perspective, the occupiers have nothing to gain - and, given the possibility of legal charges or academic sanctions, quite a bit to lose - from their protest. <em>They're not doing this because they don't want to pay tuition. </em> They're doing it because they believe in what Cooper Union stands for, and has stood for over the last century and a half. They're doing it to preserve the character of the institution for those who come after them.</p>\n<p><strong>4:45 pm</strong> | Students are still occupying. Supporters outside recently rigged up a pulley system <a href=\"https://twitter.com/studentactivism/status/276063169603063808\">with an Up-style balloon bouquet</a> to deliver a pizza up the building's facade. The New School Free Press <a href=\"http://www.newschoolfreepress.com/2012/12/03/live-cooper-union-day-of-action/\">has the text of an afternoon statement</a> from Cooper Union president Jamshed Bharucha in which he declares that the college's priority is \"the safety of our students and to insure that the actions of a few do not disrupt classes for all.\" The statement goes on to say that the administration's \"approach in the coming day(s) will continue to be one of discourse -engaging in a dialog with the students.\"</p>\n<p>Doesn't seem like a police raid is imminent.</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 6, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "New School Free Press"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union Foundation Building"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "American"}, {"count": 1, "name": "CU"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [21, 127, 169], "weight": 0.37744140625}, {"color": [230, 241, 245], "weight": 0.18505859375}], "keywords": [{"score": 33, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 31, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 29, "name": "students"}, {"score": 28, "name": "occupation"}, {"score": 27, "name": "occupying"}, {"score": 26, "name": "union"}, {"score": 23, "name": "college"}, {"score": 15, "name": "undergraduates"}, {"score": 13, "name": "foundation"}, {"score": 13, "name": "floor"}], "published": 1354618620000, "provider_name": "Studentactivism", "type": "html"}
