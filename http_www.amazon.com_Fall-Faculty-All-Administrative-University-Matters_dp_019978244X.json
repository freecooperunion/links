Ginsberg demonstrates why and how we're losing--or have already lost.\"--Theodore J. Lowi, Professor of American Institutions, Cornell University</p>\n<p><br>\"Ben Ginsberg knows a thing or two about academic bureaucracy. He has had extensive experience with administrative impediments that come between his ideas and their realization. Instead of ranting, he has written <em>The Fall of the Faculty,</em> where he has employed his political insight to examine administrative bloat in higher education and to explain the many ways in which administrative authority has elbowed aside faculty governance in the running of today's colleges and universities. As a recovering deanlet and one-time acting dean, I know whereof he speaks.\"--Matthew A. Crenson, Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Johns Hopkins University</p>\n<p><br>\"In his lacerating \"The Fall of the Faculty,\" Mr. Ginsberg argues that universities have degenerated into poorly managed pseudo-corporations controlled by bureaucrats so far removed from research and teaching that they have barely any idea what these activities involve. He attacks virtually everyone from overpaid presidents and provosts down through development officers, communications specialists and human-resource staffers but he reserves his most bitter scorn for the midlevel \"associate deans\" and \"assistant deans\" who often have the most direct control over the faculty. Mr. Ginsberg refers to them as \"deanlets,\" but at my institution they are often called \"ass. deans.\" The Fall of the Faculty\" reads like a cross between a grand-jury indictment and a call to arms. Yet as bracing and darkly pleasurable as this call is, it is hard to imagine professors joining the resistance with so few weapons at their disposal.\"--The Wall Street Journal</p>\n<p><br><strong>Benjamin Ginsberg</strong> is the David Bernstein Professor of Political Science, Director of the Center for the Study of American Government, and Chair of the Center for Advanced Governmental Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
