Founded in 1859 by Peter Cooper, the premiere institution was designed to level the playing field for gifted students who were unable to pay for an education at neighboring city schools such as Columbia. Rated as high as any Ivy, Cooper Union is a National treasure in art, architecture and engineering.</p>\n<p>Sadly, Cooper's founding mission may be compromised later this month when tSome feel that charging tuition is the only way the school can tackle its crippling debt.</p>\n<p>Having grown up in the city, I have seen some of the most talented artists I have known matriculate at Cooper Union-people I admire to this day and who certainly would not have been able to afford full college tuition.</p>\n<p>This sticky issue will not be resolved by the time Cooper Union's board votes. But the very possibility that, with the stroke of a pen, a generation of the most talented artists may be out of luck, terrifies.</p>\n<p>Cooper Union's struggles are symptomatic of a larger trend in the city surrounding not only around arts education, but the creation of art in general. Increasing financial obstacles have forced artistis to flee to further and further reaches of the five boroughs. We want NYC to be <em>the</em> arts center of the world, but we cannot seem to find a \"profitable\" way to nurture our talent for the sake of our future culture.</p>\n<p>There was once a time in the city when artists had affordable housing and space to create and think. There was the fabled Hotel des Artistes, or even the Music Building, founded in 1979, which fostered the budding talents of famed NYC musicians such as Madonna and the Ramones.</p>\n<p>Are those days over in New York? We're trying to remain hopeful that they're not.</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 3, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Unionhas"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Artistes"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Ramones"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Madonna"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Columbia"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [1, 1, 1], "weight": 0.673828125}, {"color": [249, 249, 249], "weight": 0.326171875}], "keywords": [{"score": 31, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 18, "name": "arts"}, {"score": 18, "name": "artistes"}, {"score": 18, "name": "talents"}, {"score": 14, "name": "city"}, {"score": 13, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 13, "name": "nyc"}, {"score": 12, "name": "education"}, {"score": 11, "name": "union"}, {"score": 10, "name": "tsome"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Newyorknatives", "type": "html"}
