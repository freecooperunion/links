Campus security made an effort to drill or saw through their doors that afternoon, but soon relented and haven't again tried to dislodge them.</p>\n<p>Since then, students have staged a series of support actions outside the building. They've also hoisted pizza up to the occupiers with a balloon-launched pulley.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday supporters of the occupation disrupted a meeting of the Cooper Union board of trustees, which went on to give its unanimous approval to president Bharucha - even as a growing list of faculty members have publicly affirmed their support for the college's free education mission.</p>\n<p>Despite several scares - police helicopters overhead a few days ago, NYPD in the Foundation Building earlier this afternoon - there have been no arrests or threats of arrest. Cooper Union administration statements have been critical of the occupation, but non-threatening, saying most recently that their \"primary concern is for the safety of all students and to ensure that the actions of a few do not disrupt classes and final exams\" while also expressing \"concern\" about \"actions and conditions that could affect the safety of the public.\"</p>\n<p>For their part, the occupiers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion/status/277135890512502784\">tweeted just moments ago</a> that they remain \"safe, secure, and in good health.\"</p>\n<p>Tomorrow there's <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/events/573964845952525/?notif_t=plan_user_joined\">another day of action</a> planned, starting with a Washington Square Park rally and culminating in a pots-and-pans march to Cooper Union and an \"after party\" at four.</p>\n<p><strong>Monday Update</strong> | <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/cooper-union-students-end-occupation-of-suite-after-a-week/\">The occupation has ended peacefully.</a></p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 6, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York"}, {"count": 1, "name": "East Village"}, {"count": 1, "name": "NYPD"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Washington Square Park"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [21, 127, 169], "weight": 0.37744140625}, {"color": [230, 241, 245], "weight": 0.18505859375}], "keywords": [{"score": 26, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 22, "name": "union"}, {"score": 22, "name": "occupation"}, {"score": 20, "name": "bharucha"}, {"score": 13, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 12, "name": "students"}, {"score": 12, "name": "action"}, {"score": 11, "name": "college"}, {"score": 11, "name": "occupiers"}, {"score": 10, "name": "support"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Studentactivism", "type": "html"}
