That occupation came to a head today, as tweets from @FreeCooperUnion testify.</p>\n<a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/04/29/the-tragedy-of-cooper-union/\">Here's an essay on Cooper Union's troubles, past and present.</a> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/nyregion/cooper-union-to-charge-undergraduates-tuition.html?pagewanted=all\"><b>Some background from the New York Times</b></a>:<br></p>\n<blockquote>The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, which is one of the last tuition-free colleges in the country but has been under severe financial strain, announced on Tuesday that for the first time in more than a century it will charge undergraduates to attend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Free Cooper Union @FreeCooperUnion 55m<br> A large number of private security have entered foundation bldg.
