A large group of Cooper students and three faculty members have taken over President Jamshed Bharucha's office, in the hopes of forcing his resignation. They report to Gothamist that they're willing to stay as long as necessary. While Bharucha inherited massive debt, some <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/04/29/the-tragedy-of-cooper-union/\">off-the-record reports</a> make it sound an awful lot like he's got blood on his hands.

Mira Schor reported from a small, poorly-attended protest yesterday to save the New York Public Library, and from the sounds of it, it's not going well. The Central Library Plan involves demolishing the historic stacks and shipping 1.5 million books to a storage space in New Jersey.

In a public forum held this week, New York mayoral candidate Joe Lhota apologized for waging war with the Brooklyn Museum in the 1990s. While deputy mayor to Rudy Giuliani, the city pulled the museum's funding; in turn, the museum sued. Lhota then went on to put his foot in his mouth during the same conference, referring to the Port Authority police force as \"mall cops\".

From 4-8 PM on Friday, the park will be home to Jasper Spicero's \"Open Shape\", an undercover exhibition of 3-D printed objects. Here's what \"Open Shape\" looked like in Wichita, Kansas.

[<a href=\"http://theworstroom.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>]</li>\n\t<li>The Guggenheim's \"Gutai: Splendid Playground\" closed yesterday, but Ben Davis summed up the entire exhibition quite nicely. Gutai fizzled out in the early 1970s due to a split among factions: those who didn't mind making tech-inspired work for government-sponsored exhibitions, and those who thought that conflicted with their progressive ideals. Today, Davis writes, Western artists are only beginning to understand Gutai's lesson: \"the price paid when critical art becomes repurposed as high-tech entertainment.\" [<a href=\"http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/898988/the-success-and-failure-of-gutai\">ARTINFO</a>]</li>\n\t<li>The National Design Awards have been announced.<a href=\"https://www.cooperhewitt.org/national-design-awards/2013-winners\"> [cooperhewitt</a>]</li>\n</ul><p>Tagged as: <a href=\"http://www.artfagcity.com/tag/debt-fair/\">Debt Fair</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artfagcity.com/tag/free-cooper-union/\">Free Cooper Union</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artfagcity.com/tag/gutai/\">Gutai</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artfagcity.com/tag/joe-lhota/\">Joe Lhota</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artfagcity.com/tag/national-design-awards/\">National Design Awards</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artfagcity.com/tag/new-york-public-library/\">New York Public Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artfagcity.com/tag/open-shape/\">Open Shape</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artfagcity.com/tag/the-worst-room/\">The Worst Room</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artfagcity.com/tag/waterside-park-playground/\">Waterside Park Playground</a></p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 3, "name": "Gutai"}, {"count": 2, "name": "New York Public Library"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Joe Lhota"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Free Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Jasper Spicero"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mira Schor"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Gothamist"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Port Authority"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Brooklyn Museum"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Kansas"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York Daily News"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Save Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Tribeca"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Wichita"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Davis"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Lhota"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Chelsea"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Rudy Giuliani"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New Jersey"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Guggenheim"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Ben Davis"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Bharucha"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [99, 6, 69], "weight": 0.086181640625}, {"color": [247, 247, 251], "weight": 0.071044921875}, {"color": [151, 17, 107], "weight": 0.04833984375}, {"color": [226, 177, 215], "weight": 0.022216796875}, {"color": [197, 67, 154], "weight": 0.022216796875}], "keywords": [{"score": 40, "name": "gutai"}, {"score": 28, "name": "lhota"}, {"score": 23, "name": "library"}, {"score": 22, "name": "playground"}, {"score": 20, "name": "postmasters"}, {"score": 20, "name": "spicero"}, {"score": 20, "name": "bharucha"}, {"score": 18, "name": "waterside"}, {"score": 18, "name": "jasper"}, {"score": 17, "name": "cooper"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Artfagcity", "type": "html"}
