We have visited, hung around, and we will continue to do so and offer whatever we have that you might need. The past 48 hours have energized us, have challenged us to seek the places we could revivify our struggle on our campus, have helped us to remember fully and to refocus our attentions. But even as we are prompted to look back and recognize the many student struggles that feed your occupation, we equally recognize the absolute urgency of today. We hope this occupation will be infectious. We need it to be so. December 2012 is a tipping point for Cooper Union, but Cooper Union today must be a watershed for our student movement. We are grateful and excited.</p>\n<p>In the president's meeting today, some in the crowd shouted that to expect free tuition is incomprehensible. This position - that education without tuition is ludicrous - is often bolstered by comparing no- or low-fee institutions like yours to those like our own, whose undergraduate fees amounts to a sum more or less equal to the median yearly income of NYC households. Somehow, our situation, in which the entire yearly earnings of a family would be spent on one students' tuition, in a city in which income and work are so thoroughly striated by gender, race, and legal status - this is somehow more plausible.</p>\n<p>What logic makes something that was possible in June seem unthinkable in December? Cooper Union was free, just as CUNY was in 1970 (following an occupation by Black and Puerto Rican students demanding open admissions). Why not now? Administrators claim spikes in tuition are a natural offshoot of the crisis, as if it wasn't the administrations' plans that made the university vulnerable to the vicissitudes of capitalist crisis in the first place. Jamshed Bharucha rehearses an argument typical of adminstrators' euphemistic austerity boosting: Cooper Union's funding structure was \"shortsighted.\" Cooper Union is a relic in an age of student debt, that mechanism that perpetually defers the crisis by deflecting it onto working class futures. We do not let pass without notice the deep irony of calling free education shortsighted while the average trade of financial equity brokers lasts a matter of microseconds.</p>\n<p>As we roam through the rubble of financialization's impact on higher education, it is clear that pressuring administrations to find new investors for endowments is not a solution. Should, then, we press for a reclamation of the welfare state, and recenter public education in the production and stabilization of a fully-employed working class? Let us be clear: there is no going back. Industrialists like Peter Cooper founded free schools in capitalist societies, and we live this contradiction coming to a head. So, we turn away from administrators, from capitalist benefactors, from the talking heads and the haters. We turn to your occupation, recognizing it as the only kind of place in which we can think through and construct the education, and society, we want.</p>\n<p>Yours,</p>\n<p>Some feminist faculty and students at NYU</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 6, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "NYU"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "CUNY"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Puerto Rican"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union Occupation"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [241, 243, 246], "weight": 0.046630859375}, {"color": [48, 55, 66], "weight": 0.0068359375}, {"color": [115, 111, 123], "weight": 0.00439453125}, {"color": [75, 79, 90], "weight": 0.001708984375}, {"color": [190, 39, 56], "weight": 0.001708984375}], "keywords": [{"score": 35, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 34, "name": "occupation"}, {"score": 26, "name": "union"}, {"score": 26, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 25, "name": "students"}, {"score": 22, "name": "capitalist"}, {"score": 20, "name": "education"}, {"score": 17, "name": "december"}, {"score": 16, "name": "shortsighted"}, {"score": 15, "name": "nyu"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "The New School Reoccupied", "type": "html"}
