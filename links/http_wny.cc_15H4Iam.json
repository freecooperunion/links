The school is projected to have a $12 million annual deficit.</p>\n<p>\"We appreciate that these decisions are difficult for everyone to accept,\" the board's statement read. \"We look forward to working together with all of you to building a future that will ensure the preservation of Cooper Union as a great educational institution that remains true to Peter Cooper's founding principles.\"</p>\n<p>Founder Peter Cooper wanted to create an institution that provided a quality education for those who might not otherwise afford it.  </p>\n<p>\"Education is a human right and nobody has the credibility to make that argument better than the Cooper Union,\" said architecture professor David Gersten. \"And the fact they just squandered that for some cash flow deficit is absurd.\" </p>\n<p>Students with the greatest financial needs will continue to pay nothing.</p>\n<p>The new rule won't go into effect until the incoming class in 2014.
