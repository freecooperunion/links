By 2008, the operating budget returned a surplus, according to the <em>Times</em> article, the endowment had climbed to $710 million, and the $250 million, 12-year capital campaign launched in 2002 had produced more than $20 million per year.</p>\n<p>Beyond the restructured Chrysler Building lease that will bring a total of $32.5 million in annual revenues plus an estimated $20 million in tax equivalency payments, there were a number of other successful real estate transactions during this period. It is often stated that the college borrowed $175 million to build a new academic building. This is a gross misrepresentation of a complex transaction that consolidated the institution's existing debt, permitted the college to add $34 million to its investment portfolio, and, most importantly, enabled the development of 51 Astor Place (the old engineering building) that returned $100 million to the endowment in 2008. In addition, the latter, together with the 26 Astor Place transaction, assuming a reasonable investment return together with rents or tax equivalency payments on those properties, yield annual revenues that more than cover the debt service on the loan. These were, in fact, very sophisticated deals that brought a net positive financial return to the college while yielding a state of the art building without which the college could not have sustained a first rate engineering school. These transactions are clearly not a source of the college's current financial woes.</p>\n<p>Operating a free university, offering degrees in critical, technology intensive disciplines, has always been an enormously challenging proposition financially, and Cooper Union has been close to giving up this aspect of its mission many times before. While I do not know enough about the current financials to comment on the decision to charge tuition, I have to believe there are other choices that could be made.</p>\n<p>George Campbell Jr., Ph.D.<br> President Emeritus<br> The Cooper Union</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 3, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Astor Place"}, {"count": 1, "name": "George Campbell Jr."}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York Times"}], "favicon_colors": null, "keywords": [{"score": 35, "name": "college"}, {"score": 25, "name": "million"}, {"score": 21, "name": "transactions"}, {"score": 21, "name": "endowment"}, {"score": 17, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 17, "name": "astor"}, {"score": 17, "name": "financials"}, {"score": 16, "name": "building"}, {"score": 15, "name": "union"}, {"score": 15, "name": "editor"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Archpaper", "type": "html"}
