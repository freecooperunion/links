Nonetheless, the response has been extreme and overwhelmingly disorganized.</p>\n<p>Mirroring similarly ineffective protests from the Occupy Wall Street effort in 2011, students at The Cooper Union occupied the office of President Jamshed Bharucha and interrupted this spring's commencement ceremonies.</p>\n<p>Despite obvious student outrage, the newly instated tuition spike seems necessary for the school, which faced financial strain this past academic year.</p>\n<p>The school blames the financial crisis mainly on miscalculation of managing endowments. The college upgraded its engineering facilities prior to receiving funding; they never secured sufficient donations after the fact and, in order to climb out of self-inflicted debt, were forced to charge tuition.</p>\n<p>With the institution of student tuition across all three of the college's schools on both the undergraduate and graduate level, the school better ensures students a worthwhile education.</p>\n<p>Student tuition, in addition to the private funding the school receives, will allow The Cooper Union to provide better resources for its students. Without tuition charges, the quality of education would be sacrificed and the school would likely be forced to close eventually.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there still resides a dilemma for students looking to obtain a college education but do not have the monetary means. The Cooper Union is just one example of rising tuition costs that have risen at colleges and universities across the nation.</p>\n<p>If tuition increases -- or in the case of The Cooper Union, the incarnation of student tuition altogether -- are treated as a temporary measure only, students will likely react in a more favorable manner and schools can provide the best education until the economic strife is solved.</p>\n<a href=\"http://umd.uloop.com/news/view.php/91080/the-cooper-union-tuition-spikes-what-does-it-mean-for-students\">By Mel DeCandia, University of Maryland</a> <p><b> Follow Uloop on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/uloop\"> www.twitter.com/uloop </a></b></p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 4, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "The Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Art"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mel DeCandia"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "University of Maryland Follow Uloop"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Advancement of Science"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [213, 227, 232], "weight": 0.03759765625}, {"color": [50, 127, 121], "weight": 0.01953125}, {"color": [41, 44, 45], "weight": 0.00537109375}], "keywords": [{"score": 73, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 66, "name": "students"}, {"score": 40, "name": "schools"}, {"score": 31, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 23, "name": "colleges"}, {"score": 22, "name": "union"}, {"score": 20, "name": "uloop"}, {"score": 20, "name": "education"}, {"score": 13, "name": "financial"}, {"score": 11, "name": "nonetheless"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Huffingtonpost", "type": "html"}
