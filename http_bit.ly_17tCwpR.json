The discussions in Washington Square Park led to Strike Debt. The S17 event expanded our horizons. Now, as <em>TIDAL</em> seeks to internationalize and nationalize its project, we want to re-open the conversation. How do we learn from Detroit? From Athens? From Tunis? From Cairo? What are the means of that learning? How do we ensure that this conversation is mutual and beneficial to all? An open workshop for all hosted by Team <em>TIDAL</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>\"People Power and Politics\"<br> Dominique Nisperos<br> 12:50pm-2pm</strong><br> Introduction to the Gay Liberation Movement, discussing Carl Wittman's <em>A Gay Manifesto</em>.<br> Reading materials and outlines will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Art, Design, Architecture, and Activism\"<br> Benjamin Young<br> 1:30pm-2:50pm</strong><br> What do art, design, and architecture have to do with activism? How can artists, designers, architects, and other cultural workers contribute to a radically egalitarian and democratic public sphere? How can we imagine other forms of communication and design outside that of advertising? What forms of public discussion, critical thinking, and social and political activism can take shape against or through mass culture, and how can art and design disciplines contribute to them?<br> Participants are asked to come prepared to discuss the following readings: Mira Schor, \" <a href=\"http://huff.to/bMNi2W\">Lowering the Bar on Activism</a>,\" <em>Huffington Post</em>; Mira Schor, \" <a href=\"http://bit.ly/w0nWN7\">Books are Like People</a>,\" <em>A Year of Positive Thinking</em>; Reinhold Martin, \" <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ska7yn\">Occupy: What Architecture Can Do</a>,\" <em>Design Observer</em>; Reinhold Martin, \" <a href=\"http://bit.ly/vSD2Mo\">Occupy: The Day After</a>,\"<em> Design Observer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Song Share\"<br> Everybody Now!<br> 2:30pm-3pm</strong><br> Want to learn the May Day song?
