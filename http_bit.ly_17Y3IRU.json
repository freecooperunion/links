Sixteen students sat at a long, boardroom-style table, and for nearly three hours worked their way through the text, vivifying the occasionally shocking, mostly clinical university officials' exchanges with their own banter and repart&#233;e. Cooper Union President <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/73854/my-two-minute-interview-with-cooper-unions-president/\">Jamshed Bharucha'</a> s lines were delivered in a robot voice, played with Apple text-to-speech software, with the remaining participants acted by individual members of Free Cooper Union.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Cooper2-320.jpg\">The event had all the makings of radical political theater: cartoonish uniforms, a raucous audience, a sputtering fog machine, and plates of miniature pigs-in-a-blanket all unfolded in the awkward glare of 14 red lamps, two videographers, a photographer, and a sound engineer. The lamps, first installed when the group occupied Bharucha's office in the spring, have become something of a Free Cooper Union signature, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/72093/free-cooper-union-mounts-renegade-art-show/\">appearing</a> also in their end-of-year show in May.</p>\n<p>The transcript itself, staple-bound copies of which were provided to audience members, is a significant text in the ongoing struggle against Cooper's financial misfortunes and embattled administration. Of particular note is the final debate between board members on whether or not to admit the protestors demonstrating outside the September 2012 meeting. This is the climax of the performance - the deliberation over engaging in dialogue with the very people now reading the lines. Fittingly, the reenactment at e-flux ended at the moment in the transcript when the board members allowed Free Cooper Union to enter the room.</p>\n<a href=\"http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_4479.jpg\"><img src=\"http://hyperallergic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_4479.jpg\"></a> <p><a href=\"http://cusos.org/post/68008398352/the-politics-of-destruction-a-leaked-cooper-union\">The Politics of Destruction</a>  <em>took place at e-flux (311 Grand Street, Chinatown, Manhattan) on November 24 from 6 to 9pm.</em> </p>\n<p>Tagged as: <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/e-flux/\">e-flux</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/free-cooper-union/\">Free Cooper Union</a>, <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/tag/jamshed-bharucha/\">Jamshed Bharucha</a></p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 5, "name": "Free Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Chinatown"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Village Voice"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Apple"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Manhattan"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Bharucha"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [59, 66, 72], "weight": 0.033447265625}, {"color": [30, 184, 237], "weight": 0.016357421875}, {"color": [87, 133, 153], "weight": 0.0126953125}], "keywords": [{"score": 40, "name": "e-flux"}, {"score": 31, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 30, "name": "bharucha"}, {"score": 22, "name": "union"}, {"score": 20, "name": "jamshed"}, {"score": 19, "name": "transcript"}, {"score": 17, "name": "free"}, {"score": 16, "name": "lamps"}, {"score": 15, "name": "chinatown"}, {"score": 11, "name": "members"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Hyperallergic", "type": "html"}
