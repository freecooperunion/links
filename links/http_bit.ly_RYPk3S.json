Cooper Union has been tuition-free for 110 years, but financial hardship has prompted the administration to instate tuition fees. The <a href=\"http://www.cusos.org/students-for-a-free-cooper-union-lock-in-to-cooper-unions-foundation-building-to-preserve-free-education-2/\">lock-in</a> was in response to what students feel is a lack of transparency and accountability from the administration that threatens the college's long-standing commitment to free education.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meu0cpz9Cr1r75aah.jpg\"><br><br>For the entire week, students on the ground, <a href=\"http://cusos.org/\">online</a>, and locked in the clock tower organized and rallied to support the issue and demand change. Leave it to brilliant art and engineering students to execute creative methods of peaceful protest and solidarity. The <a href=\"http://creativetime.org/projects/teach-4-amerika/\">Bruce High Quality Foundation</a>, made up of Cooper Union alumni, played an instrumental role in demonstrating their support, including delivering pizza up to the 8th floor via <a href=\"http://creativetime.tumblr.com/post/37210912145/whoa-bruce-high-quality-foundation-is-sending\">balloon</a> and hosting a dance party in the rain outside the Foundation Building. A city-wide <a href=\"http://www.cusos.org/photos-videos-and-reflections-on-the-free-cooper-union-rally-dec-8th-2012/\">rally</a> was held on Saturday, December 8th, bringing together students from schools across the city and the Cooper community, including alumni who graduated as early as 1946.</p>\n<img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meu0e5miCt1r75aah.jpg\"><p>At noon today, Monday, December 10th, supporting faculty and the dean of the art school accompanied the eleven students down from the 8th floor after a full week of occupation. The students were each carrying a rose given to them by the dean and were welcomed by a cheering fans and the press. A <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/27631865\">statement</a> was given by the lock-in students explaining that the Cooper Union community has reaffirmed their commitment to the mission statement of the school and they will work together on the ground to achieve the goals they set out.</p>\n<img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meu0ldbazJ1r75aah.jpg\"><p>There was impressive press coverage throughout last week, as well as solidarity displayed online via <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FreeCooperUnion?fref=ts\">facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion\">twitter</a>. Livestream video coverage of the Peter Cooper suite documented the occupation and <em><a href=\"http://www.cusos.org/\">Students for a Free Cooper Union</a></em> regularly updated their blog. The lock-in is over, but the fight for a free Cooper Union and against student debt across the country is just beginning.</p>\n<em>Text and photos by Creative Time Communications Intern <a href=\"https://twitter.com/foebster\">Phoebe Pundyk</a>.</em> <img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_meu0k6AJDD1r75aah.jpg\"></div>", "entities": [{"count": 5, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Bruce High Quality Foundation"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Creative Time Communications"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Peter Cooper Suite"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Free Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Phoebe Pundyk"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [245, 249, 250], "weight": 0.90576171875}, {"color": [30, 30, 32], "weight": 0.04736328125}, {"color": [123, 146, 160], "weight": 0.046875}], "keywords": [{"score": 41, "name": "student"}, {"score": 40, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 30, "name": "lock-in"}, {"score": 28, "name": "8th"}, {"score": 22, "name": "union"}, {"score": 16, "name": "creative"}, {"score": 15, "name": "alumni"}, {"score": 13, "name": "foundation"}, {"score": 13, "name": "floor"}, {"score": 13, "name": "eleven"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Tumblr", "type": "html"}
