And what's happening is it's being turned into a business.\"</p>\n<p>The statement from Cooper Union:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The simple, sobering fact is that The Cooper Union's expenses exceed its revenues. Ignoring that won't alter fundamental reality: the present financial model is unsustainable. Despite having achieved $4 million in cost reductions, the weight of a long-standing structural deficit, intensified by the recession, has left the institution with a $12 million annual deficit-or 20% of its cash budget.</p>\n<p>That is why the President asked the faculties of the School of Art, The Albert Nerken School of Engineering and the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture each to submit plans for generating sufficient revenue to lead to a sustainable future. The plans of the engineering and architecture schools have been submitted and are being reviewed by the Board of Trustees. The art school prepared a plan, but a quorum of the school's faculty, several days later, attached a post-script preventing the plan from being considered, saying the School of Art Faculty \"opposes the very principle of generating revenue through tuition from academic programs,\" including summer school or graduate programs. That course is unsustainable.</p>\n<p>This is an existential crisis, not a plebiscite about tuition. It should also be obvious that little is served by staking out a high road that leads off a cliff. Rather we must openly confront the challenges we face and by doing so-responsibly, inventively and cooperatively-preserve this great institution today and for generations to come.</p>\n<p>Early admission applications to the art school will be considered as part of the general admission pool. We regret any inconvenience caused to these students.</p>\n<p>We remain committed to a sustainable institution that is true to the legacy of Peter Cooper-based on the highest standards of academic excellence and merit-based admission.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 5, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 3, "name": "School of Art"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Samantha Balaban"}, {"count": 1, "name": "The Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Ontario"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Victoria Sobel"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Sobel"}, {"count": 1, "name": "U.S.A."}, {"count": 1, "name": "Board of Trustees"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Law"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper Union SOS"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Albert Nerken School"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Patrick Collingworth"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Canada"}, {"count": 1, "name": "School of Art Faculty"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Irwin S.
