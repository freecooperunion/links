Cooper Union recently approved graduate student tuition for the first time in its 110-year history, and students fear the undergraduate program may be next. The students received additional support from faculty members, while the administration has avoided direct communication with them. On Tuesday, <em>Democracy Now!</em> 's Martyna Starosta and Nemo Allen visited Cooper Union to interview student supporters, alumni, faculty and Cooper Union President Jamshed Bharucha, who walked away after being asked, \"Will Cooper Union remain tuition free?\"</p>\n<p><strong>UNIDENTIFIED:</strong> I'm sorry. You guys aren't allowed in the building.</p>\n<p> My name is Saar Shemesh. I'm a recent transfer student to the School of Art. At the establishment of our school in 1859, Peter Cooper left a very, very large endowment which, through investment and alumni and private-private companies and collectors, has sustained Cooper Union and the free tuition model until now. Free tuition is something that I completely rely on. The crux of this education is that it remains free. And if it's not free, then it's not Cooper Union. It's just like every other college. It's just like RISD, MICA, Parsons, any other elite art school. Cooper Union is different, and it's imperative that more schools take the model that Cooper was founded on. I find it just ridiculous that the president thinks that reinstating tuition will solve our problems.</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 8, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Martyna Starosta"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "School of Art"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York City"}, {"count": 1, "name": "RISD"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jamshed Bharucha"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Parsons"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Saar Shemesh"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Nemo Allen"}, {"count": 1, "name": "MICA"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [238, 242, 243], "weight": 0.05224609375}, {"color": [0, 1, 2], "weight": 0.0068359375}, {"color": [58, 71, 74], "weight": 0.00341796875}], "keywords": [{"score": 44, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 33, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 30, "name": "union"}, {"score": 25, "name": "student"}, {"score": 20, "name": "free"}, {"score": 16, "name": "schools"}, {"score": 15, "name": "alumni"}, {"score": 13, "name": "faculty"}, {"score": 10, "name": "risd"}, {"score": 10, "name": "110-year"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Democracynow", "type": "html"}
