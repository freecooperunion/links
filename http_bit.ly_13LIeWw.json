school safety agents on how to deal with troubled students.</p>\n<p>The Post says Dr. Ablon's approach looks at ways to avoid traditional punishment for students with behavioral issues, like suspension or arrest.</p>\n<p>Instead, he focuses on problem solving, communication, and coping with stress.</p>\n<p>The Post says Ablon will start by training staffers at 10 city schools with the highest rates of disciplinary problems and that the program will eventually spread throughout the city.</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 2, "name": "Post"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Dr. Stuart
