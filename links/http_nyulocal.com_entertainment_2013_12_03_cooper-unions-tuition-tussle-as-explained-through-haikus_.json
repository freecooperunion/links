Ranging from lengthy reports to emails to \" <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.552061344874688.1073741863.391957684218389&amp;type=1\">Helpful Information for Administrative Assistants</a>,\" the issues at stake to the administration in these materials include <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.557338627680293.1073741878.391957684218389&amp;type=1\">\"identifying the radicals\"</a> within the student body, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=557643194316503&amp;set=pb.391957684218389.-2207520000.1386052603.&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">considering replacing Cooper's legendary art school with a computer science program</a>, and most troublesome, hiring a PR company to represent the administration during their announcement of and transition to tuition installation.</p>\n<p>All of the documents are now available on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FreeCooperUnion\">FCU's Facebook page</a>. To cap it off, FCU and the Cooper alums from the Bruce High Quality Foundation also gathered at the art gallery e-flux to stage a reading of Board minutes <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/05/cooper_union_secret_transcript.php\">leaked by the Village Voice</a> earlier this year. Those minutes set the tone of this batch of leaked documents, which show the Board and the University President talking an awful lot about their image and not very much about tuition alternatives.</p>\n<p>In a statement to the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304011304579217944154839458\">Wall Street Journal</a> last week on the school's \"tuition tussle,\" spokesman Justin Harmon had \"no comment about these documents or their validity. Taking any issue out of context, when many hundreds were discussed, distorts more than it reveals.\" Although we don't know where the documents came from, how many were released to FCU, or how these fifteen were chosen, it seems distorted that in addition to the issues in these leaks, which Harmon doesn't deny were issues relevant to the board, there have been hundreds more issues on the table in these meetings that the school's students have never been invited to discuss.</p>\n<p>To present the topics of discussion in these documents as the center of the conversation would be false, but if we can assume their authenticity - and we have yet to be told otherwise - their language is revealing of the way CU's administration considers itself to be working against students, rather than alongside them, in making a decision that will ultimately dump the consequences of the school's financial bad luck and mismanagement on its student body. In a document from 2010, the administration <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=556524204428402&amp;set=a.556524131095076.1073741875.391957684218389&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">decided to allocate</a> just $70,000 ($20,000 annually and $50,000 upfront) to developing a community-building program for their historically low-giving alumni, but later in the document criticizes CU students for their \"sense of entitlement rather than gratitude.\"</p>\n<p>By contrast, this year, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.556522397761916.1073741874.391957684218389&amp;type=3\">administration spent $1.4 million</a> to hire a new group of image consultants - the cost of a little more than 35 $39,600 full-tuition scholarships, enough to cover an entire incoming undergrad class to the School of Architecture. Those neoliberal profiteering practices of targeting \"consumers,\" spending a lot on branding, and taking as little responsibility as possible for services rendered, come up again and again in the administration's language. In 2010, before Bharucha began his tenure as University President, the school's development was already <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=556524234428399&amp;set=a.556524131095076.1073741875.391957684218389&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">being discussed</a> as like \"successfully bringing a product to market\" with an \"appropriate price point.\"</p>\n<p>The negotiations reached between FCU and the administration would require a task force to assemble and produce viable alternatives by yesterday, December 1. That date was also set as current Chairman Mike Epstein's last day and the start date of the nonvoting student-elected representative to sit in on CU's first student-monitored Board meeting, but due to a discrepancy over definitions of free election, that representation has been forestalled.</p>\n<p>The Board will have their regular meeting this month on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=557093201038169&amp;set=a.557093181038171.1073741877.391957684218389&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">December 11</a>, preceded by a four-hour dinner the night before.
