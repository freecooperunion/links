I just completed my first year at Cooper. I recently was a part of a video chat between those protesting in the President's Office and a group of students from the incoming Class of 2017. I did some speaking in that discussion, but I felt that I could not say all I had to say. I get emotional when I think about the future of Coop... er Union, and seeing the immediate future up there on the screen made it hard for me to collect myself. I thought it would be good to take some notes and compose this letter to you all, to say the things I wanted to say but couldn't find the words for at the time.<br><br> When I consider the future of the Cooper Union, I think of my nieces and nephews. I think of the world they're inheriting. I wonder if they'll be able to go to college, if it will be worth it, what education will mean for them, if they'll be part of a peer group that continues to be burdened by the enormous costs of education, aspirations worn down by that system's inefficiencies. It is often written that the crisis and scandal of Cooper Union is a crystallization of a national struggle in higher education in general, most recently in ArtInfo's article by Ben Davis:<br><br> \" The attack on education in our era of austerity is a nationwide - rather, worldwide - phenomena. Without changing the larger picture, the same forces that are affecting institutions of higher learning everywhere are going to continue to press Cooper. Turning the tide of policy towards respecting the value of education as a public good is the only real sustainable solution for everyone. Conversely, accepting the inevitability of the situation at Cooper without anger only helps further set the limits of what is \"realistic\" to expect from the system - which right now isn't working very well, saddling young people with ever-greater levels of debt in return for pursuing their dreams. <br><br> One way or another, Cooper Union will end up being a symbol - either of an ideal to be reached for, or of the terrible present-day wisdom that says that ideals only matter for those who can pay. \"<br><br> I firmly believe this to be the case. If you've ever yearned to be an actor in history rather than just a member of its audience, there is hardly a more exhilarating place to be as a college student than here at Cooper, here in a small, swiftly-beating heart of something much larger and more long lasting than each of our singular educations, whatever that means for each of us. This is an opportunity to act, to do excellent things, to serve and protect a tremendously worthy and fragile ideal. <br><br> It is also a responsibility. If the Board of Trustees has their way, you, the Class of 2017, will be the last class admitted on a full-tuition merit based scholarship. If those of us in the community fighting that decision have our way, you won't be. But either way, you all know you've been given an amazing gift, an unbelievable chance. Your lives will be changed forever, I guarantee it. But that gift must be repaid in citizenship, in contribution to our small community. It will be difficult, extraordinarily so, to juggle your work and your participation in the politics of the school and your personal growth, but you have to try. <br><br> This is not an attempt to tell you what to think. Of course, I put my bias on display, writing this from the desk of the President in the midst of a student direct action against the administration. But still, I do not want what I am writing to serve as a form of pressure, but rather as a way to help in the process of alleviating the pressure of not-knowing. I remember that pressure vividly from being in your shoes last year. Cooper is a lot to try to figure out, and it will take a long time to get comfortable here. That's part of why it's so exciting, but the current events and circumstance can also cause a lot of anxiety.<br><br> By responsibility and citizenship, I mean a responsibility to try to confront that anxiety head-on rather than avoiding it, to do the research, to look at the history of the school and particularly the history of the last two years, the problems facing the school, the divisions, the range of possible solutions, the actions, the words, the politics, all of it. <br><br> You're part of it now, whether you knew it when you received your admission or not. Being a part of the art school, I can speak very specifically to the incoming art students- you were hand-chosen. At least twenty hours of attention went into each of your applications before you were selected for your individual qualities and their compliments to the rest of the class. Professors will know you. They will know your names. They will know where you're from. They will have seen your work. The school has decided, in a very personal, very unique way, that it wants you to be a part of its community for the next four years, that it's willing to provide a full scholarship for you to do so. <br><br> This is a form of respect, and a tremendous gift. A lot will be asked from you in return: good faith to your fellow classmates, who are just as much your teachers as anyone else will be; good faith to yourself and your work. You will make until you can't make any more. Then you'll make more. Then you'll write a couple papers. Try to take care of yourself, but know that this is the reality. Get sleep, try to eat well. You'll need it to get used to sleepless nights and constant stretching of your capabilities. You'll be taken apart, laid bare, and empowered to build again with new clarity. Your classrooms will take the diffuse light of you and your fellow students and refocus it into something shockingly coherent, collectively, a light that lets you see farther into your work and into each other as a community of learners, a light that makes the paths we all must take more visible.<br><br> Pair this process with the dedication to understanding and participating in the future of the school that I urge that you do, and you've got two educations for the price of none. I couldn't tell you where I learned more, in my classes and studios or in organizing, discussing, and taking action together with students, a family that has given me strength all year. <br><br> Please take your time. This is an urgent moment, a historic moment, but please pay attention to yourself as well. Your responsibility is not to act rashly, but rather to develop your understanding, to be critical, to pay attention deeply. Read. Think. Reflect. But whatever you do, don't ignore things. Be a member of the school, in all the ways that the factors of physical location (little scraps of land in the deep of Manhattan) and situation (ideological, vast, complex, widely implicating) and people (dedicated, remarkable, nourishing, challenging, sometimes adversarial, healing, empowering) exist and create a school. Whatever results of the attention I ask that you pay, whether or not you agree with x, y, or z, what is essential is that you have thought about things. Don't waste this chance.<br><br> I know a lot of this is pretty heavy to be walking into. You're not coming to a normal school. You probably know that though, thats probably why you're coming, and thats why I'm excited, and the whole school is excited, to see you here. <br><br> I'll probably see you at orientation. I'm working on a presentation on the protest history and a general 'what's going on here'.<br><br> Good luck y'all.<br><br> P.S. Some brief things I wish I had been told: <br><br> The school is frugal, we don't have a lot of resources to that make things cushy for us. If you need help, if you need advice, be persistent. Don't take 'no' or 'I don't know' for an answer as questions come up for you, whether its with your financial aid or your work study or your schedule or registration or whatever- it just takes a little dedication sometimes to get things cleared up asking different people. Perseverance is respected, so don't feel like a pest when you're trying to figure things out. Join student council if you have any desire, its really cool but sometimes its hard to know how to plug in. Just go for it, the same advice of persistence applies. Go to the shows. Starting later in the fall, senior shows will start to go up with openings every Tuesday evening. This is a vital part of the school. Take risks- the riskiest decisions I've made have been the best this year. Remember it gets cold in New York. Go to everything, there's usually free food and cool information. Be uncomfortable, but take care of yourself and others. Hang out on the steps. If you like coffee, try Abraco sometime (biggest regret of the year is how long it took me to try their drip). Think about what it means to be a student, to receive an education, and be pro-active about it. If you have questions, ask people- between the entire community here at Cooper, we can do anything. Its a long story, but my whole time here was changed just by asking an upperclassman with help with radio technology for a 3D design project last fall. Small things go a long way. Everyone wants to help. Its tempting to make assumptions about each other based on which school we're in, but try to treat people as individuals, not as their school- Artists aren't like this, engineers aren't like that, and architects aren't like the other- we're all students and people trying to do our thing. </p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 6, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 3, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Ben Davis"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Board of Trustees"}, {"count": 1, "name": "P.S."}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jakob Biernat"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Manhattan"}], "favicon_colors": [{"color": [54, 97, 163], "weight": 0.040283203125}, {"color": [0, 0, 0], "weight": 0.012939453125}, {"color": [243, 245, 249], "weight": 0.00927734375}], "keywords": [{"score": 47, "name": "school"}, {"score": 40, "name": "cooper"}, {"score": 37, "name": "students"}, {"score": 32, "name": "education"}, {"score": 26, "name": "thing"}, {"score": 25, "name": "trying"}, {"score": 22, "name": "classes"}, {"score": 22, "name": "take"}, {"score": 22, "name": "know"}, {"score": 18, "name": "2017"}], "published": null, "provider_name": "Facebook", "type": "html"}
