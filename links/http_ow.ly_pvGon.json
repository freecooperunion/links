Students at the Capilano University wrecked their sculptures as a sign of what they thought cuts would do to their futures. Their protests were organised and publicised on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CapUArtEviction\">their Facebook page</a>.</p>\n<p>Jennifer O'Keefe, a sculpture student at Capilano who was part of the protest, says: \"The cutbacks show a difference in attitude towards the arts, as if it was merely an inconsequential activity rather than an empowering vital force.\"</p>\n<p>Despite their best efforts, Capilano activists failed to stop management closing their courses, but O'Keefe and others have found practical solutions, such as creating an arts facility for the community to use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FreeCooperUnion\">Students at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art</a>, an art and engineering university in New York, fought hard against the introduction of tuition fees. Earlier this year activists occupied the university president's office and held talks and made artwork, <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/free-cooper-union\">livestreaming the protest</a> so that students around the world could watch. </p>\n<p>Students at Cooper Union also used graffiti and a magazine, which they called a \"disorientation guide\", to let new students know about politics at the university.</p>\n<p>Lawrence Lek, an artist and Cooper Union graduate, organised an exhibition in London to support the New York students in their campaign for free education.</p>\n<p>Lek believes that art students in the UK are just as political as those elsewhere in the world, but they just choose to protest in different ways. He says: \"Artists often work in ways that challenge social structures. It's important to recognise that protest can be private as well as public. Gradual processes are just as necessary as direct forms of action.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/universityoftheartslondon\">University of the Arts London</a>'s students union held their own protest in support of students suffering cuts in Canada and America, after hearing about their actions via social media.</p>\n<p>As well as protesting against the cuts, arts students and lecturers are coming up with alternatives. The Open School East launches in London this month; it's a new art school set up by artists and curators who believe in free art education. </p>\n<p>The school is funded by the Barbican and Create London and artists will offer free tuition. Its founders describe it as following \"principles of cooperation and experimentation\".</p>\n<p>The school offers a year-long studio-based programme, with 13 students receiving tuition from international artists, theorists and curators; as well as a space for local residents to run activities.</p>\n<p>Artists are resisting education cuts in new ways and creating alternatives within their own communities. The sector is communicating on a global scale and staging interventions for single issues in multiple countries.</p>\n<p>As policymaking becomes increasingly global and our education system moves further toward the US-model of high fees and higher debt, strategies for fighting it are becoming collaborative: working not just beyond our own studios and dark rooms, but even beyond our borders.</p>\n<p>Art students are taking to the streets to protest for a new education, but also using protest as a form of performance art in itself.</p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 3, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Canada"}, {"count": 2, "name": "New York"}, {"count": 2, "name": "London"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Lek"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Capilano University"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Advancement of Science and Art"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Lawrence Lek"}, {"count": 1, "name": "O'Keefe"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jennifer O'Keefe"}, {"count": 1, "name": "University of the Arts London"}, {"count": 1, "name": "UK"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Capilano"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Barbican"}, {"count": 1, "name": "America"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Create London"}], "favicon_colors": null, "keywords": [{"score": 66, "name": "students"}, {"score": 56, "name": "art"}, {"score": 48, "name": "protest"}, {"score": 30, "name": "capilano"}, {"score": 28, "name": "artists"}, {"score": 20, "name": "lek"}, {"score": 20, "name": "tuition"}, {"score": 20, "name": "education"}, {"score": 17, "name": "cooperation"}, {"score": 16, "name": "school"}], "published": 1380889953000, "provider_name": "Theguardian", "type": "html"}
