On paper, full tuition for the 2012-13 school year was $38,550, but students received 100% scholarships.</p> \n<p>The board's decision last week wasn't unanimous, but Mr. Epstein wouldn't disclose the vote tally. \"Tuition being charged is not gravy,\" he said to students and faculty members gathered at the school's Great Hall. \"This is money that is necessary to keep us going.\"</p>\n<p>The trustees warned in November 2011 that they were considering charging tuition to fix a rapidly deteriorating financial situation. The college, which enrolls about 1,000 undergraduates and has small graduate programs, then faced a $16 million annual budget gap, which is now down to $12 million, Mr. Epstein said.</p> \n<p>The decision bucked the school's unofficial motto, \"free as air and water,\" which many, including the school, often attributed to founder Peter Cooper. \"The free [as] air and water turned out to be a myth,\" Mr. Epstein said.</p> \n<p>Cooper Union was one of the few top schools to remain tuition-free in an age when the cost for a year at most private universities tops $40,000. </p> \n<p>Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, in Needham, Mass., had fully subsidized tuition until fall 2010, when it began charging students for half of what it said was the cost. Other schools, such as the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, continue to offer education free of charge.</p> \n<p>Cooper officials last year moved to charge students in an expanded graduate program and add other revenue-producing courses.</p> \n<p>The college, founded in 1859 by New York City industrialist Peter Cooper, had been fully subsidizing tuition since soon after the turn of the century. Large gifts from the Cooper family and steel magnate Andrew Carnegie made the subsidies possible, Mr. Epstein said. </p> \n<p>The schools' trustees have lamented the lack of alumni giving in recent years. Mr. Epstein said only about 20% of alumni gave back.</p>\n<p>Ian Markell, 21 years old, said he left Parsons the New School for Design to study art at Cooper Union. He said graduating without debt would mean starting out with \"a totally free horizon.\"</p> \n<p>\"It shouldn't be exclusive but a universal experience,\" he said. \"Education is something people should be entitled to.\"</p> \n<p>The move to charge tuition sparked outrage among some current students and faculty members who had been protesting the proposed change. Some students had <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/12/04/students-barricaded-in-cooper-union-livestream-protest/\">occupied a university building in December</a>.</p> \n<p>Peter Buckley, a history professor at the school, said he thought the decision had been made long ago.</p> \n<p>\"It's a real tragedy,\" he said. \"It reflects the condition of higher education as a whole. Costs are out of control.\"</p> \n<p>Consultants told the college that about 25% of students would likely still receive full tuition, Mr. Epstein said. When running the numbers, he said the school found an unusual problem: It couldn't analyze what percentage of current students would need financial aid because it usually didn't bother asking students about their families' financial situations.</p> \n<p>The school has a projected $12 million annual deficit and is facing rising expenses, such as health-care costs that are increasing 7.5% annually, Mr. Epstein said. Some assets, such as the Chrysler Building, have helped sustain the university to a certain extent. But Mr. Epstein said that even with rent increases that will go into effect after 2019, the rate of growth wouldn't keep up with inflation.</p> \n<p>The school has also relied on investments and fundraising to continue providing tuition-free education. For years, trustees said, the school hired presidents for their academic credentials, not their fundraising prowess.</p> \n<p>In a tense and at times hostile meeting with students and faculty members on Tuesday, Mr. Epstein took written questions about the decision.</p> \n<p>Students and faculty members at the meeting said they worried that some high-quality students would choose other schools if Cooper Union began charging tuition. \"If people are coming here merely because we're free,\" Mr. Epstein replied, \"we're doing something wrong.\"</p> \n<p>-Jackie Bischof contributed to this article.</p> \n<p> <strong>Write to </strong> Lisa Fleisher at <a href=\"mailto:lisa.fleisher@wsj.com\">lisa.fleisher@wsj.com</a> </p> \n<p> <strong>Corrections &amp; Amplifications</strong> <br> In an earlier version of this article, Ian Markell's last name was incorrectly spelled as Marshall. </p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 10, "name": "Epstein"}, {"count": 4, "name": "Cooper Union"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Cooper"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Ian Markell"}, {"count": 2, "name": "Peter Cooper"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Philadelphia"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Manhattan"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New School for Design"}, {"count": 1, "name": "New York City"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Needham"}, {"count": 1, "name": "lisa.fleisher@wsj.com Corrections & Amplifications"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Peter Buckley"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Curtis Institute of Music"}, {"count": 1, "name": "East Village"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Parsons"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Lisa Fleisher"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Mark Epstein"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Franklin W.
