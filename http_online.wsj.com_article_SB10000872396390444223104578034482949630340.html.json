Gucciardo and Cacciatore married in February and have found collaborating on contemporary design to be the best outlet for their creativity. Mr. Cacciatore purchased the penthouse co-op in 2006 for $785,000, according to the couple.</p>\n<p>After they decide to embark on a project, Mr. Cacciatore, 40 years old, works on the financials and decides on a budget. Then together, they interview architects, work on the interior design and source materials-from the granite to the chandeliers. </p> \n<p>\"We have a very symbiotic relationship when it comes to both design and entertaining in general,\" says Mr. Gucciardo, 44.</p> \n<p>When there isn't a natural agreement, \"We divide and conquer,\" says Mr. Cacciatore.</p> \n<p> For example, he says they settled a disagreement about bathroom materials by each choosing his own bathroom to design in the two-bathroom, one-bedroom space. </p> \n<p>Mr. Cacciatore oversaw the master bathroom with black counters and a stone floor. He picked mother-of-pearl tiles to intersperse on the wall, after their spiked patterns reminded him of the Chrysler building, which he can see from the bathroom window. </p> \n<p>The bathroom also features an electric glass door that becomes transparent when switched on, allowing the light from the window to filter into the bedroom. The idea for the glass came from seeing it employed in corporate boardrooms, says Mr. Cacciatore, who is chief of staff at Cooper Union.</p> \n<p>Mr. Gucciardo, who has a background in science and works as a program director for a volunteer health organization, designed the guest bathroom in light, neutral colors with pale green marble tiles on the walls and floor.</p> \n<p>They were also able to raise the ceiling by two feet in parts of the penthouse after discovering spare space above the overhead lights. Mr. Cacciatore estimates the apartment is 1,100 square-feet.</p> \n<p>The couple spent eight months and $350,000 on renovating, a cost that included new furniture after their previous apartment on the 27th floor of the building was sold furnished. \"I think the right person for this apartment would probably want it this way as well,\" says Mr. Cacciatore, \"but maybe that's just my own bias.\"</p> \n<p>While the sale of furnishings in their current apartment is up for negotiations, the couple won't part with their artwork collection, which they have purchased as gifts for each other over the years. The latest, a gift for Mr. Gucciardo, is a freehand drawing of a Ferris wheel by William Steiger, which hangs in the living room.</p> \n<p>Both men were born in the same hospital in Brooklyn (\"It was meant to be,\" says Mr. Gucciardo) and see their renovations as an extension of their relationship. They each admit to being \"excellent cleaners\" who rarely argue about keeping the space clutter free.</p> \n<p>\"We're very similar...if something falls you have to pick it up. Everything has its place,\" says Mr. Cacciatore. </p> \n<p>One source of conflict is Mr. Cacciatore's habit of leaving paper towels on the kitchen table after using them, intending to use them again. \"That's as juicy as it'll get,\" says Mr. Gucciardo.</p> \n<p>The apartment, unfurnished, is on the market for $1.35 million with Elaine Clayman of Brown Harris Stevens. </p> \n<p>Mr. Cacciatore picked up design skills by assisting with work on various properties that his father owned. </p> \n<p>Through Mr. Cacciatore, Mr. Gucciardo also became interested in design, and now says he has become the driver behind finding new spaces to redo. He is on the lookout for a loft space, one of the \"true blank canvases,\" he says.</p> \n<p>\"Being able to find a space, and to think about how you can create an environment in which you will find joy, and share that joy...there's a lot of fulfillment in that,\" says Mr. Cacciatore. \"You're producing something.\"</p> \n<p> <strong>Write to </strong> Jackie Bischof at <a href=\"mailto:jackie.bischof@wsj.com\">jackie.bischof@wsj.com</a> </p>\n</div>", "entities": [{"count": 13, "name": "Cacciatore"}, {"count": 6, "name": "Gucciardo"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Jackie Bischof"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Lawrence Cacciatore"}, {"count": 1, "name": "Messrs.
